<div id="p001">THE ASWÂN OBELISK<span class="hsmall">
WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE ANCIENT ENGINEERING.</span></div>

<h2 class="h2herein">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa701">(1) The unfinished obelisk of
Aswân lies in a quarry on the south-east side of the
mediæval Arab cemetery, being about twenty minutes walk
from the Cataract Hotel. It is approached by a small valley
leading up south-eastwards from the track of the old
Barrage railway.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the visit of King Fuad—then Sultan—in the
winter of 1920–21, only about 22 metres of the obelisk were
exposed to view, the remainder running down into a vast
heap of blocks and chips. The curious trench, made round
the obelisk for the purpose of detaching it from the rock,
has long interested visitors, and His Majesty expressed
a desire that the whole obelisk be cleared in order to
obtain, if possible, new data as to ancient methods of
quarrying, and to expose a unique monument.</p>

<p>I wish to tender my thanks to Mr. Somers Clarke for his
kindness in putting his notes on the quarrying of granite
at my disposal, and for reading and criticising my MS.
before sending it to press; to Prof. Flinders Petrie for
reading the proofs and giving many valuable suggestions;
to Mr. W. Golénischeff for the references on the Anastasi
papyrus and the Hammâmât inscriptions; to Mr. D. Watt,
Resident Engineer of the Aswân Barrage, for the loan of
books on the properties and working of granite and of
surveying instruments from the Barrage works; to the
Geological and Chemical Departments (sections
<a href="#pa713" title="go to § 13">13</a> and
<a href="#pa744" title="go to § 44">44</a>)
for their report on specimens submitted to them, and to the
Survey Department for taking much trouble in preparing my
plans for publication.</p>

<p>Mr. A. M. MacGillivray, of Aswân, took the photographs
shewn on plate
<a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late 2">II</a> and plate
<a href="#pl5" title="go to &#x70;late 5">V</a>, nos. 1 and 2, and has kindly
permitted them to appear here.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa702">(2)
I began the work shortly after the departure of King
Fuad, and soon found that the excavation would be more
extensive than I had at first supposed; the length of
the obelisk had reached 36 metres by April 1921, and the
chip-heap, covering the butt end of the obelisk, began
to shew signs of giving way. I had made arrangements, as
regards the angle of the chip-heap, supposing that the
obelisk was not larger than any of the known obelisks.
Thirty-six metres was a surprise, so, as Ramadan was
approaching, I abandoned the work for the season and
applied for a further credit to make a complete clearance.
This was done in the winter of 1921–22 by Mahmûd Eff.
Mohammad, Inspector of Edfù, assisted by Mustafa Eff.
Hasan, ‘chef de fouilles’ of the same district. I visited
the site from time to time whenever my
<span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span> other work
permitted, but it was not till the end of the tourist
season that I had sufficient time to study the obelisk.</p>

<p>During the removal of the chip-heap, we found some hundreds
of large granite blocks thrown from a quarry above on to
the obelisk; these had to be cut into two, and sometimes
into four, before our workmen could handle them. At
first we borrowed men from the Selugia quarries, but
afterwards we employed local stonemasons, who proved more
satisfactory, as they did not all want to be <i>raises</i>.</p>

<p>The total cost of the clearance was L. E. 75.</p>

<p>A word of explanation is, perhaps, needed on the system
of weights and measures used in this volume. It has been
the custom of my Department to insist on metric scales in
all plans. In the text, however, I enter somewhat deeply
into the stresses and strains set up in the granite,
and since nearly all the English engineering text-books
and tables use the ton-inch units, I have adhered to
the English system, reducing the metric linear measures
to inches in my calculations. The <i>tonne</i> and the
<i>kilogramme-per-square-centimetre</i> still convey little to
the average English-speaking engineer, who has to have
recourse to his slide-rule before being able to realise the
strains set up when they are given in metric units.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein" id="p003">CHAPTER I.
<span class="hsmall">
DESCRIPTION OF THE OBELISK.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa703">(3)
The obelisk is 41.75 metres long, lying with its point
18.5 degrees north of east, and sloping down towards the
butt at an angle of 11 degrees, making the base of the
pyramidion 7.05 metres above the level of the butt. When
complete, the obelisk would have weighed 1168 tons English.</p>

<p>It is curious that, during all the years that this obelisk
has been known, those who were interested in the ancient
methods of quarrying have not taken the trouble to clear
it. Nearly every work in which it is mentioned dismisses
it in a few sentences. Both Gorringe in his <i>Egyptian
Obelisks</i> and Bædeker give its length as 95 feet and the
width at the butt as 11 feet 1.5 inches. How they arrived
at the latter figure passes my understanding, as it was
buried under a chip-heap to a depth of 7 metres. Perhaps
the measurements were given by the original writer, whoever
he may have been, not as a fact, but as a prophecy.</p>

<p>Round the obelisk, partly separating it from the
surrounding rock, is a narrow trench, whose depth averages
about 2/3 that required to disengage it to a square section.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>
is a plan, with sections, of the obelisk to a scale of
1/100, and plate <a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late

tip and butt respectively; the trench around the obelisk
can be seen in plate <a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late
2">II</a> and in plate III, no. 1, and is discussed in
chapter ii.</p>

<p>As to the date of this obelisk, I have found
nothing which gives any real clue to it. One
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"

of <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png" width="49" height="82"
alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> mentions an obelisk of
108 cubits (56.7 metres) long, which is longer than
that of Aswân, even if we allow for the pedestal as
having been included in the measurement (see <span
class="smcap">B<b>REASTED</b>,</span> <i>Ancient Records</i>,
II, p. 156, and section <a href="#pa743" title="go to §
43">43</a> of this volume). Neither can the Aswân obelisk
be an abortive attempt to extract the obelisk, a part of
which is now at Constantinople, as the thickness of what
is now the base is only 2.37 metres, whereas the Aswân
obelisk measures 2.50 metres at the base of the pyramidion.
Unfortunately we are compelled to leave the question of the
date open, until we get some definite evidence, which may
well appear when the whole quarry is completely cleared.
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span></p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa704">(4)
There are abundant traces that the rock, from which
the obelisk was to be extracted, was reduced to an
approximately correct level by burning and wedging, the
former being used wherever possible. In the excavations,
a large quantity of burnt and semi-burnt mud bricks were
noticed, while a considerable percentage of the chips round
the obelisk and other quarries had the pinkish-brown colour
and crumbling texture peculiar to burnt granite. Some large
pieces of rock shew quite clearly how the burning was
done; it appears that a stack of dried reeds was banked
with brick, near a fissure if possible, and after firing,
the rock was easily hammered away. It is very likely that
water was poured on the hot stone to make it break up.
This method of heating and chilling is used on the granite
in India at the present day. Traces of burning are seen
in the obelisk area at A and B on plate
<a href="#pl5" title="go to &#x70;late 5">V</a>, no. 1. Such a
vast amount of stone has been removed in the neighbourhood
which shews neither wedge nor chisel marks that, without
the proof of the burnt brick and stone, we should have
been driven to the conclusion that burning was the method
employed&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class="dcaptionctr">Fig. 1.—Typical wedge-slots.</div>
</div>

<p>Wedge-marks may be seen on plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 3, on the left of
the picture&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">[2]</a>.
Typical examples are shewn on plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>,
no. 2, and in figure 1. In nearly every case I observed, a
small trench had been cut out by chisels along the proposed
line of fracture, presumably to get below the surface,
which is often decomposed by exposure, and which would
crumble instead of tearing the stone apart. As to whether
these wedges were of wood, and made to expand by wetting,
I am not certain, but I believe that they were not, the
reason being that the slots always taper inwards, and it
appears to me that a wetted wedge would tend to spring out
rather than exert a lateral force on the stone. In the only
case where I have seen wetted wedges used (experimentally
on limestone), the wedge-slots were cut with parallel walls.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1" id="fn1">[1]</a>
In some cases a ferruginous (?) stratum in
the granite has decomposed the rock with an appearance of
its having been burnt. Long exposure of the rock also rots
it to a considerable depth, but in the majority of cases
where the rock has been removed without wedges or chisels,
neither of the above causes can have anything to do with
it.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">[2]</a>
An examination of the wedging-off of blocks
in the quarries about Aswân shews that often the wedges
have acted perfectly, but the block has not been removed. A
crowbar acting in each slot would be ample to remove most
of these. Can it be that the crowbar or jemmy of metal was
not known?</p></div>

<p>Assuming, then, that hammered metal wedges were used and
not wooden wedges made to expand by the action of water,
it remains to be seen whether the plug-and-feather method,
such as is used to-day, was employed, or whether the metal
wedges engaged with the stone without the thin sheets of
metal on either side which we now call ‘feathers’. The
advantages of the plug-and-feather method are that it
reduces the width of the slot at the top, leaving it wider
below and hence to a large extent preventing the sharp edge
of the wedge from touching the bottom of the wedge-slot,
and that, since the faces of the feathers are smooth, it
tends to <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
obtain the maximum advantage of the lateral
force exerted by the wedge in the most evenly distributed
way and with a minimum of friction. Now nearly all the
ancient wedge-slots appear perfectly smooth inside—just as
if they had been polished. This would be a disadvantage in
using feathers, as there would be a greater tendency for
them to jump out at the first blow. Nothing seems to be
gained by polishing. Personally I favour the assumption
that the Egyptians used the plug-and-feather, but the
question is best left open for the present for lack of
conclusive evidence. Photographs of two iron wedges from
the Ramesseum are given in
<span class="smcap">P<b>ETRIE</b>,</span> <i>Tools and
Weapons</i>, plate XIII, B 16, 17. They appear to date to
about 800 B. C. Feathers, of unknown date, but probably
late, are given in the same volume on plate XIII, B 22, 23.
It is a bare possibility that the smoothness of the sides
of the wedge-slots is due to the fact that the slots were
made without chisels, such as by scraping the granite with
emery-stone, or that after they had been roughed-out by
chisels they were finished by this means.</p>

<p>Sometimes, along a crack, enormous wedges were used, the
largest I noticed being 0&#x202f;m. 25&#x202f;cent. long, spaced one
metre apart. In any case the largeness of the wedges leads
us to suppose that the Egyptians must have had large
hammers. I do not think that the sledge-hammer, such as
we use to-day, was known to the Egyptians, though mallets
were common. I believe it likely that heavy rammers, used
vertically by more than one man, must have been used to
make these wedges act. Mr. C. Firth has pointed out to me
a black granite hammer found at Saqqârah, now in the Cairo
Museum. Though this example is of the Old Kingdom, it seems
quite likely that a similar hammer was used for driving in
the wedges. A photograph of the hammer is shewn in plate
<a href="#pl4" title="go to &#x70;late 4">IV</a>, no. 2. To-day the quarrymen use very small fat steel
punches in conjunction with a sledge-hammer. Some large
wedge-marks are seen in plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 2, at the top of the
picture.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa705">(5)
It seems that the intention of the Egyptians was
to leave the north wall of the north trench at a level
slightly above that of the obelisk. The exceptions to this
are the wedged-out block seen on plates
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a> and
<a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late 2">II</a>, no. 2 at
A, and the (now) entrance to the bottom of the north trench
at B. I believe these blocks to have been removed at a date
later than that of the obelisk; the block A has been wedged
out by a long channel instead of separate slots, while at
B it is obvious that stone has been removed for building,
since the inner face has been chisel-dressed. Near here,
too, I found a block containing a ‘jumped’ hole blackened
by gunpowder. Had the ancients wished to remove the trench
wall at B, there is a crack running along it parallel to
the ground, which would make its removal an easy matter by
burning from the outside&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">[3]</a>.
It seems, therefore, that the
north wall of the north trench was intentionally left; the
probable reasons are discussed in section
<a href="#pa723" title="go to § 23">23</a>. It will be
noticed, in plate
<a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late 2">II</a>, that the top of this wall has been
roughly hammer-dressed near the butt, and to a certain
extent near the pyramidion. How far it was intended to
reduce the south wall of the south trench is not certain;
it depends on the method to be used in getting the obelisk
out of the quarry, and is dealt with in sections
<a href="#pa721" title="go to § 21">21</a>–23.
There are indications that it was to be reduced to a
considerable extent. <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc3" id="fn3">[3]</a>
There is not a trace of burning within 6 feet
of the obelisk.</p></div>

<p class="pa7" id="pa706">(6)
At intervals in the trench around the obelisk there are
traces of squarish holes, generally going down to about
the level at which the bottom of the obelisk was to be.
These are seen more clearly in the south trench than in
the north, and can in some cases be traced up the side of
the obelisk itself. Besides these there are the deep holes
seen at C and D on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>. I believe that the holes C and
D were made at the very commencement of the work to study
the quality of the granite. The holes along the trench seem
to have been made with the same purpose, and as a means
of setting out the perimeter of the obelisk. There are
indications that they were made when the removal of the top
layers of rock were still in progress.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa707">(7)
From the beginning of the work on this obelisk, cracks
and fissures seem to have given a great deal of trouble and
anxiety. Though parting fairly evenly under the action of
wedges, the natural fissures of granite are most erratic;
a small crack at one level or position may, in a couple
of metres, become a fissure into which one can insert the
blade of a knife, and conversely, a fissure traceable for
5 metres will suddenly disappear. Hence every fissure or
crack, as it appeared, had to be rigorously examined, to
see its probable effect on the obelisk when completed.
The examination seems to have been made in three ways,
which I believe to have been of two dates. The original
workers method was to hammer out a depression by means
of a spherical ball of about 12 lbs. weight, of a very
tough greenish-black stone (section
<a href="#pa713" title="go to § 13">13</a>), until the fissure
either disappeared or became larger. These examination
hammerings can be seen in plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a> at <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>n</i>, and
<i>p</i>, <i>n</i> being also seen in the photos on plate
<a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late 2">II</a> no. 2
and plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a> no. 1. In the depression, sometimes at one
place and sometimes at two, a small fillet was left at the
level of the face of the obelisk, and apparently polished;
the object seems to have been to compare the state at the
surface with that at the bottom of the depression. The
second method was to chisel out a narrow channel right
along the crack and to polish it. In some cases, as at
the end of fissure <i>i</i> on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>, the three red lines,
drawn to guide the stone-cutter, can be clearly seen at
the end of the channel. It seems likely that the channel
method was that used by the later workers who examined the
obelisk as to the possibility of extracting a smaller one
from it, as the channels are only found in the parts within
the area of the smaller obelisk (section
<a href="#pa710" title="go to § 10">10</a>). I think that
the channels were cut over discolourations and superficial
flaws, recognised as such and left by the original workmen.
The statement made by Barber, in his <i>The Mechanical
Triumphs of the Ancient Egyptians</i>, that the grooves are
made at some later date with the intention of cutting up
the obelisk, is impossible, as two (<i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>)
run transversely across the obelisk, where all the wedging
and cutting in the world would not part the stone. The line
of small punch-holes at H, however, was undoubtedly made in
modern or mediæval times to extract a block from the side
of the obelisk, and it is a marvel that the obelisk has not
been used as a quarry throughout the ages. The third method
was to cut with a chisel oblong holes, tapering sharply
inwards, on the crack to be examined. It is possible that
this was the work of the original party, done in haste on
the occasion of an inspection. This method is seen at the
base of the pyramidion on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>.</p>

<p>The most serious flaws in the obelisk are those lettered
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>p</i>; any one of these
would give one seriously to think as to the advisability
of abandoning the work forthwith. <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span> Fissure <i>a</i> meets
fissure <i>b</i> and settles, once and for all, that the
pyramidion must be set back at least half a metre. Fissure
<i>c</i> is even more radical. Fissures <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> all
seem to have connection with one another and make a
considerable reduction in width necessary; those between
<i>k</i> and <i>m</i> carry a similar warning on the south side,
while <i>m</i> and <i>o</i> necessitate shortening the obelisk from
the butt end. The last fissure completely separates the
corner of the obelisk from the rest.</p>

<p>It might well be asked: Why was the work continued so long
after such bad fissures had been discovered? The answer may
be that none of these fissures appeared to be serious, even
a short distance above the present level of the face of the
obelisk. The north and south trenches do not give evidence
that the granite was in a bad state, except at <i>ab</i>, <i>l</i>,
<i>o</i> and <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>It is likely that the black line π, drawn across the base
of the obelisk to shorten it by over 2 metres, was made by
the original workers; this is indicated by the fact that,
below this line, the hammer-dressing has been left in a
rougher state than that on the remainder of the face of
the obelisk; further, the trench, which was intended to
separate the base of the obelisk, was abandoned earlier
than those on the north and south sides, probably as soon
as the fissures shewed themselves to be deep.</p>

<p>There is a curious fissure in the hole F on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a> which
runs downwards and slightly inwards to the obelisk. Like
fissures <i>k</i> to <i>m</i>, it would of itself necessitate a
reduction in the original width. It appears, at first
sight, that this is the beginning of undercutting the
obelisk, but it is not at the level at which this would be
commenced.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa708">(8)
It would not be out of place, perhaps, to speculate for
a moment on the method of obtaining a flat surface along
the upper face of the obelisk. I think the method used was
by means of boning rods—the method used to-day. For the
benefit of those not acquainted with their use, a brief
description will suffice. Boning rods are a set of equal,
usually T-shaped pieces of wood. One is held upright at
each end of the surface which it required to straighten. A
man standing at either end, if he sight along the top of
these boning rods, can see if a third boning rod, placed
anywhere between them, is above or below the line joining
them. Thus the surface can be tested anywhere along the
obelisk until it is made to slope evenly down along its
whole length.</p>

<p>Boning rods for dressing moderately large blocks of stone
are shewn in
<span class="smcap">P<b>ETRIE</b>,</span> <i>Tools and Weapons</i>, plate
XLIX, B 44–46. These measure only about 3 inches high and
their tops were connected by a cord. In the case of an
obelisk, the cord would be useless owing to the sag, so it
seems probable that the sighting method described above was
that employed by the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>In the setting out of the obelisk, no allowance is made
for the slight convexity or entasis, in a longitudinal and
transverse sense, which is to be observed in most of the
known obelisks. If there was to be a convexity, it was made
at a later stage&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">[4]</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc4" id="fn4">[4]</a>
It will be noticed in plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>, nos. 2 and 3,
that the slight convexity across the obelisk seen in some
places, does not extend the whole length, neither is it
even as regards either edge.</p></div>

<p class="pa7" id="pa709">(9)
When the face of the obelisk had been made fairly
flat by hammer-dressing, lines were scratched on it with
a chisel, and filled in with black paint. The remains of
the lines for the original scheme are clearly traceable.
These are shewn on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>, α and β. How much reduction was
allowed for as regards the final dressing and polishing, we
do not know; it was probably only the matter of a couple
of centimetres. At the west end of the south trench the
reduction of the side of the obelisk to the guide line
has been begun. This can be seen at J to K on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>.
It now forms a kind of bevel and, as far as it extends,
obliterates the vertical markings on the wall of the
trench. On the east end of the north trench the trench
itself has been moved inwards, from G to H, to be nearer
the guide-line. The reason may either be that the workers
found themselves too far from the guide-line, or that the
guide-line was changed during the progress of the work,
perhaps through fear of a fissure.</p>

<p>Before the original workers abandoned their work they seem
to have made several attempts to set out a slightly reduced
obelisk, which would avoid all serious cracks by reducing
the length and thickness of the original design. This is
seen in the lines γ&#x202f;δ&#x202f;ε&#x202f;ζ and the transverse lines
ι&#x202f;κ&#x202f;λ&#x202f;μ.
The last four lines are so faint that they can only be seen
just after sunrise or before sunset, and it is not clear
with which of the longitudinal lines they connect. On the
south side the lines are quite clear, but on the north side
there seem to have been more lines even than those shewn on
plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>. These lines γ&#x202f;δ&#x202f;ε&#x202f;ζ, do not lie at equal distances
from either of the two centre lines η and θ.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the original obelisk was
to have had a straight-edged pyramidion, as the rough edge
of the boundary trench lies evenly on either side of the
centre line η.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa710">(10)
The outline for another, and most probably later,
obelisk is set out on a new centre line θ, and keeps
closely to the north edge of the original design, avoiding
the series of fissures on the south. Just before sunset,
the tentative outlines for the curved pyramidion can be
traced; plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 3, taken at that time, shews these
lines. In this, the right-hand curve appears to engage with
a line to the north of that engaged by the curve next to
it; this is only an effect of light and they really engage
as shewn on plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>.</p>

<p>I have outlined the original design and the later scheme,
in red. Though the lines setting out these obelisks are
easily traceable, the colouring is mine, and is only
intended to shew up the lines more clearly. Since there are
some actual red lines on the obelisk, another colour would
have been preferable; considerations of cost in printing
have limited the plate to two colours. In outlining the
later design in red, I have chosen the larger pyramidion,
as the shape decided on. There is no proof of this, but the
proportions are, to me, more effective, and there is no
reason for abandoning the odd metre of difference, as the
stone here is perfectly sound.</p>

<p>It will be seen how close the measurements of the Aswân
modified scheme are to those of the Lateran obelisk. Except
for the height and base, I have had to scale the latter off
a photograph, so the resemblance may be even closer.</p>

<p>It is also perhaps more than a coincidence that the base
of the later project is the same as that of the obelisk
fragment before Pylon VII at Karnak, namely 3.15 metres.
Legrain, writing in the <i>Annales du Service</i>, vol. V,
pp. 11 and 12, remarks, about this Pylon VII obelisk:
“L’obélisque d’Hatshopsitou mesure 29&#x202f;m. 50&#x202f;cent. de
hauteur et 2&#x202f;m. 40&#x202f;cent. à la base. Si nous admettons des
proportions semblables pour deux monuments contemporains,
la base de l’obélisque de Thoutmôsis III au <span class="nowrap">VII<sup>e</sup></span> pylône
étant 3&#x202f;m. 15&#x202f;cent.–3&#x202f;m. 10&#x202f;cent., nous arrivons au
chiffre approximatif de 37&#x202f;m. 77&#x202f;cent. comme hauteur de
l’obélisque de Thoutmôsis III dont nous avons retrouvé les
fragments cette année devant la face sud du <span class="nowrap">VII<sup>e</sup></span> pylône.
(Footnote): J’ai pris comme base de ce calcul hypothétique
(29.50 ×&nbsp;3.15)/2.46 en comptant sur la plus grande largeur
de la base, qui, dans l’antiquité, se voyait le mieux.”
This year, a fragment of the companion (or perhaps the
same) obelisk has been found, which just reaches up to the
wording of the Horus name of the king—that is to within a
couple of metres of the base of the pyramidion. Although
only one edge remains, I found that, by measuring from the
centre of the vertical lines flanking the inscription,
that the distance to the edge was 1.04 metre, making the
width here 2.08 metres, which is almost exactly that of the
outline on the Aswân obelisk. Legrain, in estimating the
height of the obelisk before Pylon VII, assumes that the
taper was the same as that of the obelisks of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span>
but, from the table above, it will be seen that the taper
of her obelisks is exceptionally small, so his estimate is
likely to err on the large side. The outline on the Aswân
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span> obelisk may therefore be either for what is now
the Lateran obelisk, or those of Pylon VII; there is no
evidence to shew for which it was intended.</p>

<p>It is likely that the later scheme was, in its turn,
abandoned from fear that the granite was not sound,
especially near fissure <i>p</i>. In any case, the reduction of
the large obelisk to obtain a smaller one would be a piece
of work almost comparable to starting the work over again
on a new site, where the rock was likely to be of better
quality.</p></div><!--section-->

<h2 class="h2herein" id="p011">CHAPTER II.
<span class="hsmall">
THE TRENCH.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa712">(12)
The trench surrounding the obelisk, by means of which
it was intended to separate it from the surrounding rock,
is of most peculiar form, the effect being a series of
parallel and equidistant vertical cuts, as if it had been
made by a gigantic cheese-scoop. Plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 1, shews
the structure of the sides and bottom of the trench. Its
width averages 75&#x202f;cent., and its depth about two-thirds
that necessary to extract an obelisk of square section.
Down the division between each concave “cut” a red line was
drawn, it appears, by a plumb-bob with its string dipped
in ochre (section
<a href="#pa744" title="go to § 44">44</a>). These lines are not continuous, but
have been projected down from time to time as the level of
the work became lower. The average distance between the
vertical red lines is 29.9&#x202f;cm., there being very little
variation between examples. These appear to be feet, and
the unit the double-foot. This is discussed in section
<a href="#pa718" title="go to § 18">18</a>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 1, that distinct
horizontal marks are visible along the wall parallel to the
bottom of the trench; these shew how uniformly the work was
kept at the same level. The aspect of the bottom of the
trench is so well shewn as not to need a description. When
the whole trench is examined, the divisions <i>across</i> the
bottom of the trench seem to run in pairs; it is difficult
to define where the resemblance between each pair lies,
but it is very clear, and I noticed it almost as soon as I
began work. A clearer feature is the division between the
depressions at the bottom of the trench separating each
into a north and a south half, shewing that the work was
done from each side of the trench alternately.</p>

<p>At irregular intervals, and not parallel either to the top
of the obelisk or to each other, are red and black lines.
They occur all over the walls of both trenches and on the
sides of the obelisk itself. On plate
<a href="#pl1" title="go to &#x70;late 1">I</a>, no. 6, I give a
diagram of the lines on the rock face U&#x202f;V, where they are
clearest and most numerous. The only explanation I can
give for them is that they are merely lines from which to
measure from time to time the depth to which the trench had
reached.</p>

<p>A feature of the surrounding trench is that there are no
corners—everything is rounded; neither are there any traces
of the marks of wedges, which are quite unmistakable (see
plate <a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>,
no. 2); besides, it is not practicable to use a wedge
unless one has to remove a part from the side of the parent
rock. Chisels also leave sure traces; examples of fine
pointing are seen in plate <a href="#pl3" title="go to
&#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 2, and rough dressing on plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 4
(which was taken in the quarries of Shellâl). There are no
traces of chisel-work in the trench at all, and not a trace
of any copper implement was found during the clearance of
the obelisk. We are therefore forced to the conclusion
that the large balls of tough greenish-black stone,
found in such profusion round the obelisk and all quarry
work at Aswân, must have been the tools employed. <span
class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span></p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa713">(13)
These stones, which I propose to call ‘pounders’,
are nearly spherical, and vary between 8 and 13 inches in
diameter, their weights ranging between 9 and 15 pounds.
On assembling a large number of them and examining them
closely, it is seen that nearly every one of them has one,
and often several, brownish-red stains, which are never
seen on the inside when a ball is broken. The balls are of
almost natural formation, and shaped by the action of water
during the ages, the stains being at the part where the
block touched the parent rock before being washed out. The
stains are caused by fissures in the original rock, which
allowed the water to enter, decomposing the surfaces. They
consist of ferric oxides from the ferrous silicates.</p>

<p>I have buried some hundreds of these pounders under the
west retaining-wall and elsewhere, as even their weight
did not prevent them from being carried off freely by
souvenir-hunters.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Firth has given me some stone chisels from the
district of Wady Alaqi, in Nubia, for comparison with the
pounders used on the obelisk. He tells me that rounded
stones of similar appearance to the pounders may be seen in
large numbers in the wadys of the Eastern Desert both above
and below Aswân.</p>

<p>I took some pieces of pounders, together with the chisels,
to the Geological Museum, Cairo, where they were examined
by Mr. W. F. Hume and Hassan Eff. Sadek, who have kindly
furnished me with the following report:</p>

<p>‘It has been concluded (as the results of the examination
supported by specific gravity determinations made in the
Government Analytical Laboratory), that the stone from
which the chisels were made was a diorite, the specific
gravity varying from 2.75 to 2.87. The pounders, on the
other hand, are composed of dolerite, which is a more
basic rock than the diorite, with a specific gravity of
2.93 to 3.05. Though rocks of this nature are present in
the Aswân Cataract region (see
J.
<span class="smcap">B<b>ALL</b>,</span> <i>First or
Aswan Cataract</i>, pp. 79 and 86), it is quite conceivable
that the material for these implements has come from
other localities. Rocks of this type abound in the Second
Cataract at Wady Halfa and have been used as pounders in
many gold-mining localities of the Eastern Desert, such as
the Baramia Mine where they are of wide distribution.’</p>

<p>My own examination of the Aswân quarries has not revealed
stone of precisely the same quality as that of the
pounders, and in so far tends to support the idea that the
material for chisels and pounders is derived from some
other region.</p>

<p>The wear on the pounders is not distributed evenly over
the whole surface—which would be expected if they had been
used entirely by hand—but appears in patches, shewing that
the pounders were used in one position until the bruising
surface in use had become flat, and therefore useless.
When a pounder is newly used, the bruising surface nearly
always is found at a point directly opposite to the stain,
possibly as there is always a slight flattening there.</p>

<p>In very many cases the pounder had been broken by the great
force of the blows delivered with it. I cannot believe that
a man, using one of these by hand, could break it, as the
only way I succeeded in doing so was by hurling one down
from a height of about 30 feet on to a pile of others, and
then only after repeated attempts.</p>

<p>It has long been known that the face of the granite was
dressed by means of these pounders, but I have not heard of
their use being suggested for excavating a trench in it.</p>

<p>There are many examples of monuments, partly pounded out,
now lying in the quarries of <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span> Aswân and Shellâl. Plate
IV, no. 3, shews an example where, apparently, the lid of a
sarcophagus is being shaped by this means.</p>

<p>To ascertain how much headway can be made by hand on this
kind of work, I tried, on the bottom of the trench, to see
how much I could remove by hand pounding. I found that,
after an hour’s hard work, I had extracted about five
millimetres off the surface of the foot ×&nbsp;half-trench-width
area. With practice I could perhaps have done more. I
noticed that, if I threw the pounder down and caught it on
the rebound, the granite broke up at a much greater rate;
but to do this as a regular thing would certainly result
in an accident, as occasionally the pounder rebounds at
very unexpected angles. I am certain that they were not
used entirely by hand in the regular work of cutting out
the trench, as the work would go very slowly indeed, and,
which is more to the point, it would not have the same
regular appearance that it has. There is no doubt that very
powerful blows were struck vertically downwards, sometimes
with such force as to split the dolerite pounders into
fragments.</p>

<p>The only conclusion I can come to is that the pounders were
attached to rammers, and worked on the principle of the
modern <i>mindâlah</i>, as the Egyptians call it, and with which
they are very familiar. By this means two or more men could
work from the top of the trench, while the third, working
below, held the bottom of the rammer and directed the blows.</p>

<p>As to how the rammers were attached to the pounders—if
such were indeed used—I am uncertain. It may have been
done by having the base of the rammer made slightly
concave, possibly bound with metal to prevent splaying,
the pounder being held up in its place by a metal (iron?)
ring, sufficiently large to expose enough bruising surface,
but not large enough to let the pounder slip through or
to scrape against the side of the trench. The ring would
be held up by two metal bands or hide thongs attached to
the body of the rammer. Another method of attaching the
pounders would be by a leather strap, with a hole just
small enough to keep the ball from slipping through.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa714">(14)
It might well be asked why they did not make flat
surfaces for the rammer to bear on, and with some more
convenient means of attachment. The explanation is that
once the bruising part of the pounder had worn flat, it
was of no further use, and a new part had to be selected;
besides, the spherical pounders are of natural occurrence,
and their great toughness would make any shaping a
difficult process. There are signs that the local basalt,
and even the granite, were sometimes used, apparently
without much success, as they are far inferior to the
dolerite in toughness. Since the pounders were imported, a
certain economy was essential in making the maximum use of
them before discarding&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">[7]</a>.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc7" id="fn7">[7]</a>
Hand pounding also must have been largely used
for the face dressing, for examination of fissures, and
possibly for undercutting. Some quite small hand-pounders
were also found; these had no stain on them.</p></div>

<p>The pounding out of the trench has considerable advantages
over other possible methods; these may be summed up as
follows:</p>

<ul class="ulordinary">
<li>(<i>a</i>) It is eminently suited to unskilled labour.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) The tools are durable, not easily lost and not liable
to be stolen. <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span></li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Simultaneous rhythmic labour—so popular with the
ancient and modern Egyptian—could be organized.</li></ul>

<p>The bottom of the trench gives a certain amount of
information as to how the labour was arranged. To work the
maximum number of men, with the minimum chances of one
interfering with the other, seems to me to be for each man
to have two ‘feet’ marked out for him along the trench.
Squatting with his back to the obelisk, he worked on, say,
the right ‘foot’ of his task, putting his ‘spoil’ on to the
left ‘foot’. (Handing it up would be a great waste of time,
and not removing it constantly would reduce the bruising
force of the blows almost to nil.) Each man during the
spell, be it of days or weeks, sits with his back to the
obelisk and works on his right ‘foot’. The next spell is on
the same ‘foot’ but each man works <i>facing</i> the obelisk,
and the process is repeated in exactly the same way for
the two halves of the left ‘foot’ of their tasks. A glance
at plate
<a href="#pl3" title="go to &#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 1, will shew how likely this arrangement
is, as there is just room for a man to squat comfortably,
and there is always the space of a ‘foot’ between him and
his neighbour. The men at the top of the trench, if rammers
were used, would be rather crowded, but not impossibly so.</p>

<p>The average width of the trench is about 0&#x202f;m. 75&#x202f;cent.; the
work may have been measured taking into account a minimum
width, but this is not necessarily the case, as in certain
places, the width of the trench gets smaller and smaller as
it gets deeper, and then suddenly opens out again. In any
case I imagine that the workmen would find it false economy
to narrow the trench too much, as the cramped position
would make the work go more slowly. I suggest that the
reason for the occasional narrowings is that one party knew
that their spell was coming to an end at a certain level,
and finished it quickly, knowing that someone else had to
continue the deepening.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the top-dressing, as seen at the
pyramidion, plate
<a href="#pl4" title="go to &#x70;late 4">IV</a>, no. 1, and the butt-end of the
obelisk, is less regular than the pounding work in the
trench; it seems that, with more space at their disposal,
the workmen were given an area to pound, and left to
arrange their method of doing it.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa715">(15)
As to the time which would have been taken to complete
the trench, it is interesting to get a rough approximation.</p>

<p>Assuming that, with rammers, the men can extract 8
millimetres in an hour in each quarter of their double-foot
task, then the time taken to complete the trench, with an
extra metre for undercutting, will be that of working it at
its deepest part, that is to a depth of 4.2 +&nbsp;1.0 metre,
and will equal (4 ×&nbsp;5.2)/(.008 ×&nbsp;12 ×&nbsp;30) months of twelve
hours per diem =&nbsp;7.22 months.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of time taken, we might apply
this calculation to the obelisk of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> assuming
that it was detached in much the same way. Here the deepest
part of the trench is 2.40 +&nbsp;.75 metre&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">[8]</a>;
then the time
taken would have been: (4 ×&nbsp;3.15)/(.008 ×&nbsp;12 ×&nbsp;30) =&nbsp;4.4
months. <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc8" id="fn8">[8]</a>
Since the obelisk is smaller.</p></div>

<p>It is recorded by the queen that “they are of one block
of enduring granite, without seam or joining. My Majesty
exacted work thereon from the year 15, the first of Machir
<span class="nowrap">(6<sup>th</sup></span> month), until
the year 16, the last of Mesore <span class="nowrap">(12<sup>th</sup></span>
month), making seven months of exaction in the mountain.”
Allowing for undercutting and a certain amount of top
clearance, our calculation seems within the bounds of
reason.</p>

<p>During the work of trench-pounding, the top-dressing,
embankment preparing, and clearing for the exit of the
obelisk would be carried on.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER III.
<span class="hsmall">
THE UPPER QUARRY-FACE.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa716">(16)
At the south-west corner of the obelisk there is
a kind of platform, sloping down southwards towards a
vertical face of rock. Plate
<a href="#pl2" title="go to &#x70;late 2">II</a>, no. 2, shews the obelisk
with the platform at the right, and plate
<a href="#pl5" title="go to &#x70;late 5">V</a>, nos. 1 and 2
shews the rock face viewed from below the north side of the
obelisk, and from directly opposite it. A detailed drawing
of the markings on the quarry-face is given on plate
<a href="#pl6" title="go to &#x70;late 6">VI</a>.</p>

<p>The rock face is crossed by three black lines, lettered
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, and one red line <i>d</i>. It will be seen
that the structure of the face below the line <i>c</i> is
similar to that of the side of the obelisk trench; the
intervals, too, between the vertical markings are almost
exactly the same, namely 29.8&#x202f;cm. on the quarry-face
against 29.9 on the trench.</p>

<p>It appears that, above the line <i>c</i>, the vertical markings
made by the pounding have been hammered out to a certain
extent, as if to use the upper half as a kind of blackboard.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that some monument has been removed from
before this quarry-face, and it is rather tempting to see,
in the lines <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, the levels of the top and bottom
faces of an obelisk, the line <i>b</i> being a centre line. If
this is so, the taper is 1 in 17.5, which is sharper than
the known large obelisks (see section
<a href="#pa711" title="go to § 11">11</a>). Unfortunately,
the method of detaching the monument, whatever it may have
been, is no longer traceable, as a large stratum of granite
has been removed, almost certainly by burning, perhaps
to make a control platform, destroying all traces of the
original bed of the monument.</p>

<p>Line <i>c</i> is very nearly level, and both <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are
divided into ‘feet’ by short vertical black lines each in
the <i>middle</i> of the pounded grooves. The reason for this is
not clear to me.</p>

<p>The red line <i>d</i> is separated from the black line <i>c</i> by
one double obelisk-foot; that is the distances between
the lines varies between 59.7 and 60 centimetres. The
vertical red lines are not very accurately drawn, but the
average distance between successive lines is equal to the
double-foot. The horizontal red lines above line <i>d</i> convey
no meaning to me, neither do the eyes or the <i>nefer</i> on
lines <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Down the centres of the red squares, above the line
<i>c</i>, run a series of curious chains in red—now very
faint—all of which cut the line <i>d</i>, and some the line
<i>c</i>. The horizontal lines on these chains are nearly the
same distance apart. Those above the line <i>d</i> are much
more irregular, and look like two different measures
superimposed, the lower series being similar to the chains
between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; they are, however, so faint that it
is only at <i>e</i> that the beginning of the joining of the
horizontal members can be determined.</p>

<p>I have numbered the spaces between the vertical
divisions I–XIII; below is a table giving the levels in
metres of each horizontal line in every chain, taking
the level of line <i>d</i> as unity. <span class="xxpn"
id="p018">{18}</span> I have not taken any measurement
nearer than half a centimetre, as the lines are
thicker in some places than that, and I cannot be sure
of a greater accuracy owing to the faintness of the
lines.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>It will be seen from this that the unit, if it is a unit,
is not a factor of the royal Egyptian cubit of .525&#x202f;m.,
nor of the small cubit of .45&#x202f;m., neither is it connected
with the Egyptian finger of .0187&#x202f;m. Further, it bears no
relation to the obelisk single- or double-foot. Since we
have no information as to whether this unit of .069 metre
is a sixth, eighth, tenth or twelfth of a foot or cubit,
it is rather unwise to try to reconcile it with the known
Egyptian units, as, even during the same reign, the influx
of foreign measures and the variations of the native
measures would enable us to find an equivalent to almost
any unit that could be imagined.</p>

<p>I am aware that
<span class="smcap">D<b>ECOURDEMANCHE</b>,</span> in the <i>Annales du
Service</i>, volume XII, page 215, gives the measure .06925
as a palm of the “lapidary” cubit of .4155&#x202f;m., but I place
very little reliance on this cubit, as it only explains the
dimensions of one tomb measured by Amélineau at Abydos, and
this tomb can be equally well rendered in the royal cubit
system.</p>

<div class="dtablebox">
<p>The relation of the obelisk foot to the royal Egyptian
cubit is seen in the following table:</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the actual measurements of the
obelisks, both the original and the later project, very
largely depend on the royal Egyptian cubit of .525 metre.
The height of the large obelisk does not. Probably the
order was for as large an obelisk as possible. The
dimensions of even royal cubits are:</p>

<p>Most of the remaining measurements, except the base of
the pyramidion of the later project, depend on the rock
rather than on the wish of the designers. Since the obelisk
is still in a rough state I cannot give many accurate
measurements from which the cubit can be found precisely.
The two most accurate measurements are the base of the
original obelisk and the base
<span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span> of the later project.
The former measures 4.20 or 8 cubits of .525&#x202f;m., and the
latter measures 3.15 or 6 cubits of .525&#x202f;m.</p>

<p>As to the explanation of the scales on the quarry-face,
though much is still obscure to me, I believe the lower
series of vertical scales are the records of the work of
the last shift employed in cutting out the trench by which
the monument was removed, and the semi-effaced series on
a higher level the records of preceding shifts. It seems
likely that the red chains are fortuitous, and do not
represent any particular unit, but marked the position of
the tip of a 3‐cubit rod, when standing on the bottom of
the trench, thus recording the depth reached by each party
of workmen at definite intervals of time, possibly after
every two days’ pounding.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa719">(19)
At the top, and to the right of the upper series of scales,
are very faint traces of script. They seem to have been
placed against each scale, but very few can now be seen.
I have tried to photograph them with special panchromatic
plates, but without success; the most I have been able
to do is to examine them in various lights, when dry and
when wetted, and to make hand copies. These are shewn in
figures <a href="#fig2" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a> to
<a href="#fig4" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, and are
from divisions VIII, IX and XII respectively. Figure <a
href="#fig5" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a> is an extra
group of signs to the <i>left</i> of the scale in division
VIII. The inscriptions are all in red paint and are too
fragmentary to translate.</p>

<p>It is within the bounds of possibility that the
inscriptions originally gave some information as to the
party who were working that particular double-foot division
of the trench.</p>

<p>At the extreme left of the quarry-face, in the position
indicated on plate
<a href="#pl6" title="go to &#x70;late 6">VI</a>, there is an inscription of two lines
in the hieratic character. It is very faint indeed and I
have not succeeded in deciphering it. The fact that it is
in black paint on very dark red weathered granite has made
it very difficult to photograph. It appears to begin with a
date, and to have a number in the middle, but there is no
name of a king.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa720">(20)
At the top of the upper quarry-face there is what
seems to be the bed from which a monument, very probably
a small obelisk, of 7 metres long has been extracted. The
bottom of the trench can still be traced where the work has
been divided up into grooves of similar width to those in
the obelisk trench. Here the feet have become irregular,
but the double-foot is of great regularity and measures
59.8 centimetres. Plate
<a href="#pl5" title="go to &#x70;late 5">V</a>, no. 2, shews the bed at the top
of the rock face and no. 3 the same seen from above. It
will be noticed that, in this case, the undercutting has
been done by pounding, but with less regularity than in
the obelisk trench, shewing that it was done by hand. The
obelisk seems to have been snapped off, or more likely it
broke off of itself. It is hardly justifiable to deduce
how the large obelisks were extracted from such a small
example. In all probability the principle was the same, but
the details very different. This is discussed in sections
21–23. <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span></p>

<p>At the west end of the ridge from which the monument
has been removed, there is a short inscription in red
paint. A photograph of this is given in plate
<a href="#pl5" title="go to &#x70;late 5">V</a>, no. 4.
It seems to begin with the words
<img class="iglyph-b" src="images/i021.png"

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “the work

remainder is illegible to me, though the signs are quite
clear. They resemble some of the quarry-signs I have seen
at Maʿallah and elsewhere.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER IV.
<span class="hsmall">
EXTRACTION OF OBELISK FROM QUARRY.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa721">(21)
Having examined, as far as possible, the methods by
which the obelisk was separated from the surrounding rock,
we will consider by what means the obelisk was detached
from its bed and got into a position in which it could be
handled and transported.</p>

<p>It might be remarked that this particular obelisk has <i>not</i>
been transported; there is no doubt, however, that the man
responsible for the work had quite definite ideas as to
how he was going to perform the feat. Although it is the
largest obelisk known (<i>pace</i> the phantom 108 cubit obelisk
of <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet),</span> the old engineers have actually moved
even heavier and more unmanageable blocks: the colossus of
the Ramesseum and the colossi of Amenophis III at Thebes.
If we can solve the ancient method of dealing with this
particular obelisk, we can the more easily understand how
the others were dealt with.</p>

<p>There seem to be two methods by which the obelisk could be
detached from its bed; the snapping off of such an obelisk
in the manner mentioned in section
<a href="#pa719" title="go to § 19">19</a> being out of the
question.</p>

<p>(1) By undercutting the obelisk from both sides to a
certain extent, say a quarter of the breadth from each
side, and either detaching it by a series of very large
wedge-slots (as was done all over the quarries for
medium-sized blocks), <i>or</i>, if the Egyptians used wooden
wedges, expanded by the action of water, by one long
wedge channel on each side of the obelisk. These could be
wetted by flooding the trench with water, but before this
could be done, the trench would have to be divided into
compartments by, say, mud-brick walls to prevent the water
running down to the deep end, leaving the pyramidion end
dry. In this case a large allowance would have to be made
in case the granite did not break evenly across between the
wedge-channels. The great objection to this method is the
risk of the obelisk breaking across owing to uneven strains
set up by the wedges; it will be seen, in section
<a href="#pa743" title="go to § 43">43</a>, that
the obelisk can only just support its own weight when in a
horizontal position. If this method were employed, before
the obelisk could be moved, it had to be raised off its bed
to pass ropes round it. This could be effected by levering
from both sides of the obelisk—using the outer trench
wall as fulcra—and gradually rocking the obelisk higher
by packing below it at each tilt. Assuming that only half
a metre was undercut from both sides, it would require
30 12‐inch tree-trunks going down three feet into the
trench (properly packed), and projecting 18 feet above the
trench, being used vertically, with 70 men pulling on ropes
attached to the top of each lever. The strain set up would
be about 1000 pounds per square inch, which is well within
the <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span> powers
of ordinary coniferous wood as cypress. (I
assume that a man pulls 100 pounds.) The more undercutting
performed, the less force would be required to rock the
obelisk. Since the obelisk would have to be tilted from
both sides, a good deal of rock would have to be removed
from the south side of it before the levers could be used.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa722">(22)
(2) By completely undercutting the obelisk. In
spite of the slowness of the work I am convinced that
the obelisk was completely undercut, most likely by hand
pounding, since the expenditure of copper chisels would
be terrific, and the idea, in this kind of work, seems to
be to economise as much as possible on copper. It would
be packed by wooden blocks or stone as near the centre
as is consistent with stability, and in as few places as
possible. Ropes would then be passed round the obelisk,
each going several times round and being brought forward
from below to anchorages in front. It is here that the
details of this method assume such great importance; it
must be remembered that, if the obelisk weighs 1170 tons
(allowing a margin for the roughness of the undercutting
below), and lies on its side on a hard bed, then the
horizontal pull by ropes necessary to turn it over on to a
new face will be half the weight of the obelisk, <i>i. e.</i>
585 tons. This would need 13,000 men, if a man pulls 100
pounds. I do not see how such a number could possibly be
put on to this work. Figure 6 shews the obelisk supported
on its packing, the section here being at the centre of
gravity, and the outer edge of the packing being 1 metre
from the centre of the obelisk on each side. To pull it
over by horizontal ropes would need 8000 men, which still
seems more than is practicable. It is possible to reduce
the number of men required to turn the obelisk over by
means of levers working off the north wall of the north
trench, which seems to have been deliberately left for that
purpose (cf. section
<a href="#pa705" title="go to § 5">5</a>).</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i024.png" width="800" height="1036" alt="" />
<div class="dcaptionctr">Fig. 6.</div>
</div><!--dctr04-->

<p class="pa7" id="pa723">(23)
By using, say, 30 21‐foot levers with a mechanical
advantage of six to one, as described in the last section,
the obelisk can be made to turn slightly about N (see
fig. <a href="#fig6" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>) so
that the packing P can be removed and perhaps replaced by
sand.</p>

<p>About N the moment of the force at the bottom of the
lever is to that of the weight of the obelisk acting
at its centre as 7&#x202f;:&#x202f;2 (by scaling off
the figure), so that the moment at the top of the lever
to that of the weight will be 42&#x202f;:&#x202f;2, or
21&#x202f;:&#x202f;1. Let the number of men per lever be
<i>n</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span></p>

<p>Then 30 ×&nbsp;21 ×&nbsp;100 ×&nbsp;<i>n</i> =&nbsp;1170
×&nbsp;2240, which gives the number of men as 42, or
1260 men in all&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9"
id="fnanc9">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>I have taken the amount of undercutting in figure 2 as
.75&#x202f;m. at the centre of gravity; it would increase as far
as 1.00 metre at the butt.</p>

<p>As soon as the sand had replaced the packing, the rock
A&#x2060;B would be removed by burning and wedging until it
sloped down as much as possible from the level of the bed
of the obelisk. I had not sufficient funds at my disposal
to examine the levels of the rock to the centre of the
valley, so I have to be rather vague as to what distance
the obelisk was rolled out&#x202f;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">[10]</a>. The obelisk would then,
when the sand flowed out or was removed, take up a position
as shewn in the dotted section.</p>

It will be seen that, if the obelisk lies at
too low a level to be rolled <i>downwards</i> to the valley,
it can be raised by tilting backwards and forwards by
means of levers acting from the north and south trenches
alternately, as mentioned in section
<a href="#pa721" title="go to § 21">21</a>. If the butt were
raised even a metre above its present level, it would
enormously reduce the quantity of rock to be removed before
the obelisk could be rolled out.</p></div>

<p>Then, about Q, the moment of the horizontal force of the
ropes round the obelisk to the moment of the weight will
be, from the figure, as 9 to 2, so if <i>n</i> be the total
number of men required to pull the obelisk over, then
(<i>n</i> ×&nbsp;100) =&nbsp;(2 ×&nbsp;1170 ×&nbsp;2240)/9 which gives 5824 men as
against the 8000 men which would be required if the levers
were not used. It is an enormous number, but I do not see
how they could manage with less.</p>

<p>A bank of sand just in front of the lower edge of the
obelisk would make the second turn an easy matter, and if
from thence the obelisk is rolled downwards on soft sand,
I think that the 5824 men will still be ample, as the
sand can be undercut in front of the edge and so make the
rolling approximate to that of a cylinder.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa724">(24)
As to the size of the ropes required for the rolling
out of the obelisk, all we can do is to obtain a very
rough idea as to it. If they spread the men out slightly
fanwise, I do not see how they could have used more than 40
ropes. The strain per rope will be, as we have seen, (2/9
×&nbsp;1170/40) =&nbsp;6.5 tons per rope.</p>

<p>The rope used was probably the very best palm-rope, newly
made. The safe load which can be put on coir rope, which
is of about the same strength, is given by the formula:
Load in cwts =&nbsp;(Circumference in <span class="nowrap">inches)<sup>2</sup></span> divided by
4 (<i>Military Engineering</i>, 1913, Part III A, p. 49).
Substituting, we have (6.5 ×&nbsp;20 ×&nbsp;4) <span class="nowrap">=&nbsp;C<sup>2</sup></span> which gives
a circumference of 22.8 inches and a diameter of 7&#x202f;¼
inches. If such a rope were used it would require handling
loops on it.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa725">(25)
Before leaving the work at the quarry, it remains to be
seen how the chiselling of the wedge-slots was done.
The apparent impossibility of cutting granite with a
copper chisel has struck every student of this question.
Many suggestions, some of them grotesque, have been put
forward to explain how it might have been performed.
Gorringe, in his <i>Egyptian Obelisks</i>, <span class="xxpn"
id="p026">{26}</span> boldly assumes the knowledge of
steel. To my mind, the reasons against this are, <i>first</i>:
the knowledge of steel would have soon resulted in its
use being widespread for daggers, swords and, above all,
razors; <i>secondly</i>, it would have had a special name,
since its properties are so different from iron. Now all
the ancient names for metals have been accounted for, none
of which could be applied to mean steel. If we translate
<i>Benipet</i> as ‘steel’, then we have no word for iron.</p>

<p>Gorringe’s assertion that iron and steel tools would
have disappeared by oxydisation in a few centuries is
not borne out by excavations. We know, from the scanty
mentions of iron, that it was not very generally used, but
quite a number of iron tools of late Egyptian date are
now known, and I have myself taken out an iron bill-hook
from the filling of a Roman or Ptolemaic grave which was
hardly rusted at all, and in the Cairo Museum there is an
iron fork of Coptic date from a depth of 5 metres in the
<i>sabâkh</i> of Tell Edfù which is almost like new. If the
ground is dry and free from certain chemicals, objects
such as iron, wood, linen, papyrus, etc., will keep
indefinitely, whereas, in unsuitable ground, even copper
will disappear and leave no traces, except, perhaps, a blue
stain. If steel had been in anything like common use, we
should surely have found examples, either in graves or in
town sites like Kahûn or Tell el-ʿAmarna.
<span class="smcap">P<b>ETRIE</b>,</span>
in <i>Tools and Weapons</i>, pl. VI, 187, cites a halberd of
<i>iron</i> dated to Ramesses III; had steel been known, we
should have expected it to be of that rather than iron.
An examination of such broken iron tools as can be spared
might give us definite information one way or the other,
as steel, though it may lose its temper, will not turn
into iron, however long it is left, and should be easily
recognized by a micro-photograph.</p>

written <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-b"

alt="[glyph]" />,</span> seems to suggest iron tools in
general, and we are hardly justified in deducing from this
that the chisels for cutting granite were necessarily of
iron; it is very likely, however, that the wedges were of
iron.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa726">(26)
The suggestion, put forward by Donaldson, that the
Egyptians softened the granite by chemical means before
using the chisels on it, is not worthy of serious notice,
as a glance at the tool marks shews that the granite was
quite hard, and behaved in exactly the same way as it does
under modern tools. His other suggestion, that the granite
was first pounded to render it more workable, cannot be
accepted as the explanation, as how did they pound the
bottom of the wedge-slots?</p>

<p>A far more reasonable suggestion is that the granite was
cut by chisels of dolerite or similar <span class="xxpn"
id="p027">{27}</span> basic rocks. Mr. Firth tells me
that, except for the grinding of the cutting-edge, they
occur naturally in the Wady Alaqi. A series of trials with
such a chisel left me entirely unconvinced, the more so
since many of the old chisel-marks shew that a narrow-edged
tool had been used.</p>

<p>From my own experiments, I can believe that the Egyptians
<i>could</i> have cut granite with a copper chisel, but more
time is spent sharpening the tool than in cutting the
stone, and the expenditure of metal would be appalling
in any but the smallest works, but I cannot admit that
copper tools, as we know them, could have ever been used
to cut hard quartzite, which gave the Egyptians no special
trouble, if we judge by the huge chambers which they cut,
polished and transported, as in the case of the burial
chamber in the Hawara Pyramid.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that the copper chisels were
fed with emery, but anyone who has handled a chisel will
appreciate the impossibility of feeding the tool with
emery; on the other hand, emery may well have formed the
basis of the polishing process, and have been regularly
used in stone drilling and sawing.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa727">(27)
How, then are we to explain this problem? Much as I hate to
admit it, I am driven to the conclusion that the ancient
Egyptians possessed some simple method of tempering
copper to the hardness of modern tool-steel&#x202f;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">[11]</a>;
even now copper with 2&#x202f;% of alloy may, by heavy
hammering, be brought to the hardness of mild steel.
This has been suggested by many writers, and examples
of tools are known—Wilkinson quotes one in volume II,
p. 255—where the malletted end of the chisel was worn
by the blows, but where the point was sharp; of course
that might be explained by the fact that it had just
been re-sharpened, but I have myself seen a chisel where
the cutting-edge was chipped in the same manner as a
modern steel tool instead of being burred. I was unable
to purchase this specimen, but I tried the point with a
knife, and was able to scratch it as I could any other
piece of copper; the temper, therefore, must have been
temporary (cf. <span class="smcap">W<b>ILKINSON</b>,</span>
<i>Manners and Customs</i>, vol. II, p. 255, and <span
class="smcap">P<b>ETRIE</b>,</span> <i>Arts and Crafts</i>, p.
100).</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc11" id="fn11">[11]</a>
There has lately been a rumour that a method
has been discovered in America for tempering copper, and
that a company is being formed for its exploitation; if
this is true, it will relieve archæologists considerably,
who have been at their wits’ end for a good explanation for
the last 50 years.</p></div>

<p>If this is the true solution, it is probable that the
knowledge died out when the use of iron and steel became
general, as its value in not producing sparks could hardly
have been foreseen. It is not surprising therefore that the
knowledge died out when it was no longer a necessity.</p>

<p>It might be remarked that instead of having a method of
greatly hardening copper, the Egyptians might have been
able to temper iron. The experiments on iron and its
properties during the last century have been innumerable
and, had there been a method, apart from the introduction
of carbon, of tempering iron to a very great hardness, I
think that it would certainly have been discovered by now.
In our present state of knowledge, it is best to leave the
subject as an open question.</p>

TRANSPORT OF OBELISKS.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa728">(28)
Before entering into the question of the transport of
obelisks, it may be as well to give extracts from ancient
writers. They throw very little light on the problem,
the Roman and Greek writers only giving what seems to be
third-rate hearsay information, while the Ancient Egyptians
usually confine themselves to statistics as to the numbers
of men employed.</p>

<p>King <span class="nowrap">Menthu<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />otpe</span> IV sent an expedition of 10,000 men
to the Wady Hammâmât quarries to bring in a sarcophagus,
and records that it took 3,000 sailors from the Delta
nomes to remove the lid, measuring 4 by 8 by 2 cubits,
from there <i>to Egypt</i>. This seems to shew that a pressed
gang of the amphibious Delta inhabitants from the lakes
had been taken out to the quarries. At any rate we are
told that “not a man perished, not a troop was missing,
not an ass died and not a workman was enfeebled” <span
class="smcap">(B<b>REASTED</b>,</span> <i>Ancient Records</i>,

Ramesses IV quoted below, but it gives no details of the
various kinds of artisan employed.</p>

<p>In the reign of <span class="nowrap">Amenem<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"

<p id="p030">From this it will be seen that larger parties than our
estimate of 5725 were sent much further afield than Aswân,
which itself was a garrison town. It seems to have been the
custom to use troops on this unpleasant kind of fatigue, if
captives or pressed gangs were not available in sufficient
numbers.</p>

<p>The only record that we have on the transport of an
obelisk is a passage from the Papyrus Anastasi I <span
class="smcap">(G<b>ARDINER</b>,</span> <i>Egyptian Hieratic
Texts</i>, Part I, p. 17*, § XIII), in which one scribe called
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />ori</span> writes to another called Amenemope, accusing him of
being unable to calculate the number of men required to
transport an obelisk of given dimensions. He says: “An
obelisk has been newly made .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
of 110 cubits in length of shaft; its pedestal 10
cubits square, the block of its base making 7 cubits
in every direction; it goes in a slope (?) towards the
summit (?), one cubit one finger, its pyramidion one
cubit in height its point measuring two fingers. Add
them together (?) so as to make them into a list (??),
so that thou mayest appoint every man needed to drag
it&#x202f;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x202f;”</p>

<p>Here the obelisk is very long and thin and has an
impossibly short pyramidion, but in any case such a
problem can only be solved by one who has had previous
experience, not only of the friction to be overcome in the
transport of large blocks, but of the nature of the ground
to be traversed. The figures given are only sufficient to
determine the weight of the obelisk.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa729">(29)
The largest transportation on land, of which a scene
has come down to us, is that of the winged bull of Nineveh.
This is published in
<span class="smcap">L<b>AYARD</b>,</span> <i>Discoveries</i>, pls.
X–XVII. The bull is drawn by men pulling on four cables,
and a line of men keeps on placing rollers under the front
of the sleds on which the colossus is attached. Behind it
men assist the overcoming of the initial friction with
large handspikes.</p>

<p>Another scene, this time from Egypt, is the transport
of a statue of one called <span class="nowrap">D<img
class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />ut<img
class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />otpe</span> <span
class="smcap">(L<b>EPSIUS</b>,</span> <i>Denkmäler</i>, II, 134,
and <span class="smcap">B<b>REASTED</b>,</span> <i>Ancient
Records</i>, I, 309–312). The method used here is that of
a sled, whose runners are wetted or greased, pulled on
sleepers. Though the statue was only about 22 feet high and
weighed some 60 tons, it appears to have required 172 men
to move it; we can therefore safely rule this method out as
applying to a 1170‐ton obelisk. If a sled was used, it must
have been in conjunction with rollers.</p>

<p>Greek and Roman writers throw very little light on ancient
methods of transportation. Herodotus, in book II, chap.
175, remarks: But of these, that which I not the least,
rather the most admire, is this: he (King Amasis) brought
a building of one stone from the city of Elephantine, and
2000 men, who were appointed to convey it, were occupied
three whole years in its transport, and these men were all
pilots. The length of this chamber, outside, is 21 cubits,
the breadth 14, and the height 8. This is the measure of
the outside of the one-stoned chamber. But inside the
length is 18 cubits 20 digits, and the width 12 cubits, and
the height 5 cubits.</p>

<p>Gorringe, in his <i>Egyptian Obelisks</i>, gives an almost
complete collection of the accounts of transportation,
erection, etc., by ancient authors. Many of these accounts
are so vague or improbable as to be hardly worth including
here. <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span></p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa730">(30)
Having discussed the possible methods of removing the
obelisk from the quarry, the next thing to be considered is
whether it was rolled over and over down to the river bank,
or whether it was pulled along on rollers.</p>

<p>The first way is not without its advantages, as it is
almost fool-proof. The width of the embankment or track,
of which there are many about the quarries, need only be
about one-third the length of the obelisk, and the tendency
for the obelisk to roll in a circle would be to a large
extent neutralized if it were of soft sand, where the heavy
end would sink in to a greater depth than the point end.
However, the turning would be a most laborious process, and
the general progress very slow and requiring an enormous
number of men. It is obvious that the obelisk was brought
into the temple precincts lengthways, so if it was moved a
little that way it is quite possible that the greater part
of its journey on land was so made.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa731">(31)
Plate
<a href="#pl7" title="go to &#x70;late 7">VII</a> gives
a rough plan of the quarry in which the obelisk lies. It
is accurate as regards the obelisk, embankments and the
rock faces A, B and C. It will be seen that the rock at B,
which is also shewn on plate <a href="#pl3" title="go to
&#x70;late 3">III</a>, no. 2, has been partly cut away,
presumably to let the point of the obelisk pass out of
the quarry. It may be only a coincidence, but, strangely
enough, the distance A&#x202f;C (from both ends of which
rock has been removed), is almost exactly the length of the
obelisk. My opinion is that the obelisk was only rolled
sideways for a very short distance until it was very little
higher than the level of the floor of the valley, and was
then put on to rollers running on heavy baulks of limber,
the process being:</p>

<ul class="ulordinary">
<li>(1) Track prepared before the obelisk has reached its
lowest level.</li>

<li>(2) Track and rollers covered over with soft sand, the line
of the track being marked by sighting poles.</li>

<li>(3) Obelisk rolled down on to the sand above the track.</li>

<li>(4) Sand dug away from under the obelisk. In the end,
I think that this way would be quicker than levering
the obelisk up by horizontal levers—but that is still a
possibility.</li></ul>

<p>It has been doubted that the Egyptians knew rollers,
but without them I do not see how a thousand-ton block can
be transported. After all, the Assyrians were familiar
with them in the <span class="nowrap">8<sup>th</sup></span> century B.&#x202f;C. at
latest (section
<a href="#pa729" title="go to § 29">29</a>), and there was extensive communication
between them and the Egyptians for centuries before that.
Are we to assume that the discovery was made between the
probable <span class="nowrap">15<sup>th</sup></span> century of our obelisk and the
<span class="nowrap">8<sup>th</sup></span>?</p>

<p>The Luxor obelisk, in the course of its removal to Paris,
was dragged along a specially prepared wooden track after
it had been mounted on a wooden ‘cradle’, the track being
well greased. The pulling was done by capstans and blocks
and tackles. It was found that a pull of 94 tons was
required to pull the obelisk up the slope leading to the
pedestal. This was with a 227‐ton obelisk. Since friction
with average-sized blocks is about proportional to the
weight, to pull the Aswân obelisk would need (1168/227
×&nbsp;94) =&nbsp;485 tons, which would require about 11,000 men. I
cannot believe that all these could have been arranged so
as to pull the obelisk up an embankment (see sections
<a href="#pa735" title="go to § 35">35</a>
and <a href="#pa737" title="go to § 37">37</a>). <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></p>

<p>The great advantage of rollers is that comparatively
little space is required and a minimum of pulling force;
its disadvantages are that there is always a risk of
the rollers becoming jammed, and that, even on a slight
incline, the obelisk is liable to get out of control.</p>

<p>As to the sizes of the rollers required, I can only say
that the top of the fallen obelisk of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet</span> now
rests on 20&#x202f;cent. diameter pitch-pine rollers, spaced
one metre apart, and there is not the faintest sign of
crushing. The worst stress with the Aswân obelisk might
rise to 11 times as much as the example cited.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa732">(32)
The obelisks of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet</span> were mounted on sleds, perhaps
to make an easier running surface; it would also serve to
damp any shocks and to distribute the upward pressure of
the rollers evenly along the under surface of the obelisk.
The method of attachment is shewn in figure 7 (from <span
class="smcap">N<b>AVILLE</b>,</span> <i>The Temple of Deir el
Bahari</i>, Part VI, pl. CLIV), but is rather vague. I cannot
say whether the Aswân obelisk was to have been mounted in
this way or not; if it were, then it would be put on its
sledge at the same time as it was put on the rollers, as
explained in the last section.</p>

Once on its rollers, there is a fairly level and
straight track from the mouth of the valley running along
the course of the old barrage railway (pl. VII), joining
the two large embankments D&#x2060;E and F&#x2060;G, which feed the
quarries on the south of the obelisk and on the high
desert respectively. Plate
<a href="#pl4" title="go to &#x70;late 4">IV</a>, no. 4, gives a view of the
embankment F&#x2060;G looking down to Aswân town. It joins the
course the obelisk would take at A. The modern town north
of the station prevents us determining exactly where these
embankments gave on to the river bank.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa734">(34)
On the details of the boats, on which we know the
obelisks were transported, I can offer no opinion of value,
as I am not familiar with boat design, particularly that of
the “queen-truss” type which seems to have been so popular
with the Egyptians. I will content myself, therefore, with
citing certain accounts and giving sundry references, which
may prove of use to those who intend to pursue this matter

<p>Another great boat was made by one Uni, in the <span class="nowrap">VI<sup>th</sup></span>
dynasty, for the transport of stone from Aswân. This
measured 60 cubits (31 metres) in length by 30 in width,
and took only 17 days to construct (<i>Ancient Records</i>, I,
322).</p>

<p>The construction of ancient boats is discussed in <i>Ancient
Egypt</i>, 1920, Part 1 ff. by Mr. Somers Clarke, and a
detailed description of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet’s</span> boat is given by
Naville, in his work cited above, on pages 2 to 4. Boats
are also described in
<span class="smcap">W<b>ILKINSON</b>,</span> <i>Manners and
Customs</i>, vol. I, p. 276, and vol. II, pp. 211, 212.</p>

<p>To me, the only practicable way of loading such an obelisk
on to a boat, would be by building an embankment round and
over the boat, pulling the obelisk into a position above
it, and then digging the boat and channel clear again. We
can hardly believe that the obelisk was hauled in over the
gunwale! In moving the Luxor obelisk to Paris, and the
Alexandria obelisk to New York, in the one case the whole
prow of the barge was removed, and in the other a port was
cut in the bows of the steamer through which the obelisk
was introduced (see sections
<a href="#pa753" title="go to § 53">53</a> and 54).</p>

<p>Pliny, in his <i>Natural History</i>, book XXXVI, chap. 14,
gives an account of how King Ptolemy Philadelphus had an
obelisk transported to Alexandria. He tells us, apropos
of the loading on to the boat: “A canal was dug from the
River Nile to the spot where the obelisk lay; and two
broad vessels, loaded with blocks of similar stone a foot
square—the cargo of each amounting to double the size,
and consequently double the weight of the obelisk—were
put beneath it; the extremities of the obelisk remaining
supported by the opposite sides of the canal. The blocks of
stone were removed and the vessels, being thus gradually
lightened, received their burden.” If this was so or not,
it certainly was <i>not</i> the method by which the obelisks
were brought from the Aswân quarries to the bank. No trace
of a canal of this sort is to be seen, though there are
plenty of traces of enormous embankments.</p>

<span class="hsmall">
ERECTION OF OBELISKS.</span></h2>

<p class="pa7" id="pa735">(35)
The only reference the Egyptians have left us actually
referring to the erection of a monument is that given in
the Papyrus Anastasi I (for publication, see section
<a href="#pa728" title="go to § 28">28</a>).
The monument to be erected is in this case a colossus.
The text gives (§ XIV): “It is said to thee: <i>Empty the
magazine that has been loaded with sand under the monument</i>
of thy Lord which has been brought from the Red Mountain.
It makes 30 cubits stretched on the ground, and 20 cubits
in breadth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;-ed with 100
(??) chambers filled with sand from the river-bank. The
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of its (?) chambers have
a breadth of 44 (?) cubits and a height of 50 cubits,
all of them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in their
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Thou art commanded to find out what is before the Pharaoh
(??). How many men will it take to demolish
<span class="nowrap">(<i><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hmacronbelow-1e2bi.png"
width="33" height="82" alt="ḫ" />m</i></span>—also
“remove” or “overturn”) it in six hours—if (?) apt are
their (?) minds (?), but small their desire to demolish it
without there coming a pause when thou givest a rest to
the soldiers, that they may take their meal—so that the
monument may be established in its place?”</p>

<p>Here the technical details are extremely obscure, as there
are many unknown words in the text.</p>

<p>In the same papyrus (§ XII), there is a reference to
an embankment, which may well have been intended for
the erection of a monument, perhaps an obelisk, as the
problem immediately following concerns the transport of
an obelisk from the quarry. The scribe
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />ori</span> puts the
problem: “There is made a ramp of 730 cubits, with a
breadth of 55 cubits, consisting of 120 com­part­ments (?)
filled with reeds and beams with a height of 60 cubits
at its summit, its middle of 30 cubits, its batter (?)
15 cubits, its base (?) of 5 cubits. The quantity of
bricks needed for it is asked of the commander of the army
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Answer us as to
the quantity of bricks needed. Behold its meas­ure­ments (??)
are before thee; each one of its com­part­ments (?) is of 30
cubits long and 7 cubits broad.”</p>

<p>Since the words trans­lated by “com­part­ment” and “base” are
very doubtful in meaning, it is dif­fi­cult to obtain any
definite idea as to the internal con­struc­tion of the ramp.
Borchardt supposes the words “the middle” to mean the space
filled with rubbish in the inside of the embankment as a
means of econo­mising the bricks.</p>

<p>The ‘com­part­ments’ may refer to the long­i­tud­inal
divisions in the middle of the embankment, which can
still be seen in the con­struc­tion ramp inside the South
Ptolemaic (?) pylon at Karnak. Choisy, in his <i>L’Art de
bâtir chez les Égyptiens</i>, p. 86, gives rather a good
little sketch of this, apparently made when the ramp was
newly cleared. Borchardt, on the other hand, imagines the
compartments to be transverse divisions. It is certain,
however, that there is a mistake in the measurements given
in the Anastasi papyrus, as it seems quite impossible
to <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span> divide up
the embankment according to the data, even if we take
‘compartments’ to mean the sections or towers into which
nearly all brick enclosure walls and embankments were
divided (see <span class="smcap">S<b>OMERS</b></span> <span
class="smcap">C<b>LARKE</b>,</span> <i>J. Eg. Arch.</i>, vol.
VII, p. 77).</p>

<p>It seems to me that Borchardt is right as to the
em­bank­ment being, as it were, a brick box filled
with earth; other­wise there is a great re­dun­dance
of data. Obviously, the only meas­ure­ments neces­sary
for an em­bank­ment (built of plain brick­work or in
towers like the great temple walls), if solid, are:
Hor­i­zon­tal length of ramp (L); highest part (H); width
at top (W); and the batter (B). Then the num­ber of
bricks re­quired will be, to a close approx­i­ma­tion:
½&#x2060;L&#x2060;&#x2060;H&#x2060;(W +&nbsp;B) divided by the
volume of one brick, plus a factor for waste bricks.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that if the Aswân obelisk were pulled
up an em­bank­ment of the slope given here, it would need
(neglecting fric­tion) over 2000 men.</p>

<p>Classical authors tell us next to nothing; as an example I
give Pliny’s account of an erection done by the Egyptians.
In his <i>Natural History</i>, book XXXVI, chap. 14, he tells
us: “Rhamsesis, who was reigning at the time of the capture
of Troy, erected one 140 cubits high (73 metres). Having
left the spot where the palace of Mnevis stood, this
monarch erected another obelisk 120 cubits (63 metres) in
height, but of prodigious thickness, the sides being no
less than 11 cubits in breadth (5.77 metres). It is said
that 120,000 men were employed upon this work, and that the
king, when it was on the point of being elevated, being
apprehensive that the machinery employed might not prove
sufficiently strong for the weight, and with a view of
increasing the peril that might be entailed by the want
of precaution on the part of the workmen, had his own son
fastened to the summit, in order that the safety of the
prince might at the same time ensure the safety of the mass
of stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;”</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa736">(36)
Mediæval and modern writers have speculated
freely on the ancient method of erecting obelisks,
their ideas ranging from fairly sound theories to the
assertion constantly made to me by the less responsible
spiritualists, that it was done by <i>levitation</i>!</p>

<p>Of modern theories two seem to be popular; the first
suggests that the obelisk was laid flat, with one side of
its base just above the notch, which in nearly all cases
runs along one side of the pedestal, and that it was
gradually levered up, and at the same time banked from
below, being assisted when it had become sufficiently high
by pulling with head-ropes, and similarly checked by ropes
when on the point of tilting over on to its base. This
with slight modifications, was the method used for the
erection of the obelisk of Seringapatam, and is described
by Gorringe in his <i>Egyptian Obelisks</i> (p. 157), and by
Commander Barber, in <i>The Mechanical Triumphs of the
Ancient Egyptians</i> on page 102. It must be remembered,
however, that the whole obelisk weighs only about 35 tons.
To assert that this method was that to be used for the
Aswân obelisk is not justifiable. The reasons against this
method may be summed up as follows:</p>

<ul class="ulordinary">
<li>(1) It would be almost impossible to lever up a large
obelisk, close to a pylon, on an ever-increasing earth
slope, and it could not be ‘rocked’ up as it would slip out
of the notch.</li>

<li>(2) Pulling by head-ropes, with or without the aid of
a strut or ‘raising-lever’, would be useless until the
obelisk was almost upright, even if it was done from a high
embankment. <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span></li>

<li>(3) It would not explain how
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet’s</span> obelisks were
introduced into the middle of the court of Tuthmôsis <span class="nowrap">I<sup>st</sup>.</span></li>

<li>(4) Ropes would almost surely be inadequate to stop the
obelisk from rocking out of control after it had passed
its dead centre. The New York obelisk, when being pulled
into a horizontal position about a specially made trunnion,
supposed to be at its centre of gravity, took charge,
snapped the cables and escaped breaking by a miracle.</li>

<li>(5) <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png" width="49" height="82"
alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet’s</span> standing obelisk has
(apparently) jumped forward nearly a foot in front of its
notch. It can be seen, if one pulls upright a foot-long
alabaster obelisk (sold at the Cairo fancy-shops) with
cotton threads that it is impossible to make it jump
forward after passing its dead-centre. What it does, if
the pulling is not very even and square, is to pivot on
one of its corners at the beginning or end of its first
rock, with what would be disastrous results in a large
obelisk.</li></ul>

<p class="pa7" id="pa737">(37)
The more usual explanation as to how the erecting was
performed is that the obelisk was pulled on rollers up a
long inclined embankment until it was at a height well
above the centre of gravity of the obelisk. Having been
rolled up base foremost, it was tilted over the end of the
embankment, and the earth gradually cut away from below it
until it settled down on to its pedestal, leaning against
the embankment; from thence it was pulled upright (see
<span class="smcap">P<b>ETRIE</b>,</span> <i>Arts and Crafts
of Ancient Egypt</i>, p. 77, quoted in section
<a href="#pa755" title="go to § 55">55</a>).</p>

<p>This seems a far more probable method than the last, but
from a practical point of view it leaves a good deal
unexplained. Anyone who has seen, in <i>sabâkh</i> work or
elsewhere, earth being cut from under a stone, or even
being itself undercut, knows the way it has of slipping
sideways or any way but the expected—generally on the
heads of one’s workmen. With, say, a 500‐ton obelisk, the
undercutting would be a somewhat delicate business to make
it settle down true on to the pedestal.</p>

<p>The tendency to rock and pivot when being finally pulled
upright is not dealt with. Whatever method the Egyptians
used, it was <i>sure</i>, and did not depend on the skill of the
men with the hoe and basket.</p>

<p>Before describing the method which I believe was used, it
would be well to consider what means the Egyptians had at
their disposal.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa738">(38)
Levers must have surely been familiar to the
Egyptians; the constant import of tree-trunks from Syria
would furnish them with the material, and a hundred
occurrences in every-day life, such as extracting a
stone with the point of a hoe would suggest to them the
application. The occurrence of a lever in the filling
of a tomb at El-Bersheh is published by M. Daressy in
<i>Annales du Service</i>, vol. I, p. 28, where he remarks: “On
a retrouvé une branche d’acacia taillée en biseau à une
extrémité qui avait dû servir de ciseau et de levier pour
soulever le couvercle”.</p>

<p>In several of the temples in the Theban area and—Dr.
Reisner informs me—in the temple of the third pyramid at
Gizeh, one may see large blocks, undercut at various points
along their length as if to take the point of a lever.
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span></p>

<p>Rollers, too they must have known, even if they did not
get the idea from the Assyrians. We know that they used
sleds running on sleepers—at Lahun pyramid the tracks have
actually been found—and it is incredible that the greater
ease in pulling, when a small sled ran over a stick, should
escape their notice. It might be asked why the statue of
<span class="nowrap">D<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />ut<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />otpe</span> was <i>not</i> pulled along on rollers, instead of
on a sled only (cf. section
<a href="#pa729" title="go to § 29">29</a>). The reason seems to be
that, given a moderate sized block and plenty of men, the
progress would be quicker, as the sled does not need the
constant adjustment and attention which is required by
rollers. As we have already remarked, the friction renders
the use of sleds alone impossible for a large obelisk (cf.
section
<a href="#pa731" title="go to § 31">31</a>), so, since it appears that obelisks must have
been brought into the temple precincts endways, there is no
other means we know of other than rollers.</p>

<p>Several pieces of wood, which were probably used as
rollers, were found in the débris round the Lahûn Pyramid,
and are published in
<span class="smcap">B<b>RUNTON</b>,</span> <i>Lahun I, the
Treasure</i>, plate XX. They vary from a foot to about 8
inches in length, having diameters from 2 to 3 inches. The
ends of all the examples are rounded. It is strange that,
in the quarry and chip-heap cleared at El-Lahûn, so few
workmen’s tools were found with the exception of wooden
mallets and sleepers.</p>

<p>Dr. G. A. Reisner, in reply to my question as to
whether any rollers had been found in the course of his
excavations, has kindly sent me the following note. “At
Nuri (Ethiopia) we found two short thick granite rollers
in the chamber of Pyramid VIII, where there was a granite
coffin, weighing 7–8 tons, which may have been used for
moving the coffin from the foot of the stairs through rooms
A and B to its place in C. We actually used these rollers
in moving the coffin out.” He gives the date of these
rollers as about 550 B. C.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa739">(39)
On the other hand, it appears that the capstan and the
block and tackle, arranged to give a large mechanical
advantage, were quite unknown until quite late times.
No trace has been found of them in the town-sites
excavated in recent years, nor is there any trace of
their derivatives, such as the spoked well-drum in one
case or the application of the other for hauling up the
sails of ships. In the scene of the expedition to Punt in
the time of <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png" width="49" height="82"
alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> an examination of the sail
halliards reveal nothing in the nature of a block and
tackle.</p>

<p>Sheers, gyns and derricks may well have been known in
principle, but for moving weights like those of obelisks,
these are of no use except in conjunction with the capstan
and block and tackle. When the Luxor obelisk was being
lowered for removal, in spite of the elaborate calculations
of the stresses set up in the wooden sheers, and of the
good modern carpentry used in their construction and the
steady pull given by the capstans, the structure crushed
and jammed, and it was only by the use of screw-jacks
that the necessary repairs could be made. This was with a
227‐ton obelisk!</p>

<p>A method which may have been used, and which I should
myself attempt if I were entrusted with such a piece of
work, is as follows:</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa740">(40)
A square funnel is first built round and above the
pedestal on which the obelisk is to stand (see plate
<a href="#pl8" title="go to &#x70;late 8">VIII</a>),
leaving a space about half a metre high, and one and a
half metre wide, clear over the edge of the pedestal, to
lead out to a tunnel. The sides of the funnel, which are
<span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span> of smooth masonry, are set at a slope so that the
obelisk on being lowered into it can lie against the wall
of the slope without passing its dead-centre and coming of
itself to an upright position. The sides of the funnel are
continued upwards—perhaps in brick, for economy—until the
height of the funnel is well above the centre of gravity of
the obelisk; the higher, the better. Around the funnel the
brickwork would be brought out to form a square tower, with
the pylon wall for its revetement, perhaps, on one side.
The tunnel mentioned above leads from the pedestal to the
further wall of the tower.</p>

<p>A long sloping embankment (section
<a href="#pa735" title="go to § 35">35</a>) is made to lead up
to the top of the platform, and a gentle curve cut in the
brick (A) to lead down to the interior of the funnel. In
the case of the obelisk of
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> the platform must
have been at a high enough level to clear any buildings in
the way.</p>

<p>The obelisk is then pulled up on rollers, base foremost,
until it just overhangs the slope A. The funnel, previous
to this, is filled with the finest Aswân sand, which has
very little cohesion in its particles, banked high against
the butt of the obelisk. The sand is then very gradually
removed from the tunnel, thus letting the obelisk slowly
down on to its pedestal. In this process, men would
descend with the obelisk until the masonry portion of the
tunnel was reached. Precautions would have to be taken, by
banking the sand up before the butt of the obelisk and, if
necessary, by inserting wooden struts between the butt and
the wall B of the funnel, to prevent the obelisk jamming
against it. After the masonry is reached, there would be
little fear of a jam.</p>

<p>There is fairly good proof that blocks and statues were
lowered on to their beds by emptying sand-bags which
supported them. Choisy, in his <i>L’Art de bâtir chez les
Égyptiens</i>, takes it for granted that this method must have
been used for obelisks as well. His suggestion—or rather
description, for he might well have been there—of how the
Egyptians erected their obelisks, on page 124, is not to be
taken seriously, except perhaps for the smallest obelisks
(see section
<a href="#pa750" title="go to § 50">50</a>).</p>

<p>If the method I suggest, or a modification of it, was that
used for the erection of the largest obelisks, sand-bags
are not necessary at all.</p>

<p>As to the flow of fine blown sand, I can speak from
personal experience on the matter, as I have several times
approached a big tomb-shaft filled with blown sand from
below, having entered by another tomb breaking into it.
The sand always lay sloping from the roof of the chamber
joining the shaft to the floor, at an angle of about 20
degrees. It can be easily and safely removed from below
without bringing down an avalanche. I am very sure that, at
the end of the tunnel, no constant flow will occur, even
when the sand is being pressed down by a 1168‐ton obelisk;
it is more likely that men would have to remove the sand
from half-way along the tunnel.</p>

<p>The bottom of the funnel would have to be slightly larger
than the base of the obelisk, so as to be able to remove
the sand, stones and brick fragments which might have come
down with it.</p>

<p>If all went well, the obelisk, when it touched the
pedestal, would lie against the near wall of the funnel
with its base engaging in the notch. Men would then enter
through the tunnel, and clear out all particles of sand
from the surface of the pedestal and, if necessary, from
around the base of the obelisk. <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span></p>

<p>Before passing the proofs of the volume, but after plate
VIII was printed, I made a wooden model of a funnel of
almost exactly the same proportions as that shewn on the
plate. The height of the end of the embankment was 30
centimetres. This I tried with a 1/100 scale model of the
obelisk in limestone, using finely sifted Aswân sand.</p>

<p>The result was interesting, since it shews the great
importance of unsuspected details in this kind of
undertaking.</p>

<p>In the model, I did not use a tunnel, but allowed the sand
to escape at any desired rate through an aperture in the
stand on which the model was placed. Since the model was
not fixed to the stand, the position of the aperture with
regard to the bottom of the funnel could be varied.</p>

<p>I found that, if the aperture was on the side away from the
embankment, there was a decided tendency for the obelisk
to jam against the opposite wall of the funnel. If, on
the other hand, the sand ran out from the near side, the
obelisk came down resting against the embankment wall, with
its edge where the slot should be. It seems most likely
that the sand was removed, not from the tunnel shewn on
plate
<a href="#pl8" title="go to &#x70;late 8">VIII</a>, but from one on the opposite side, leading out
from under the embankment. The tunnel shewn in the plate
seems necessary for the proper cleaning of the pedestal
before the obelisk was pulled upright.</p>

<p>In a subsequent model, in which the side of the funnel was
vertical and made of glass, I was enabled to examine the
base of the obelisk and the levels of the sand during the
descent. The results shewed no reason for modifying the
diagram on plate
<a href="#pl8" title="go to &#x70;late 8">VIII</a> except in the manner mentioned above.</p>

<p>It is possible that the sand was removed from above until
the obelisk was low enough for there to be no fear of a
jam; after that point had been passed, it would not matter
from which side of the pedestal the sand was removed.</p>

<p>I realise that if the model were enlarged up to full-size,
the grains of sand would be at least one centimetre in
diameter. It seems to me that, using ordinary sand with a
full sized obelisk, the flow would be better than is the
case in the model, as there would be less skin-friction
with the sides of the funnel. On the other hand, there may
well be factors, unforeseen by me, which might render the
behaviour of the full-sized obelisk different from that
of the model, so I give these results without insisting
that they are a <i>proof</i> that such a method is possible for
erecting obelisks.</p>

<p>Another point arises in connection with the funnel; this is
the possibility of the <i>side</i> walls of the funnel having
been constructed vertically, the width of the funnel
being only slightly greater than the width of the base of
the obelisk. The advantage of this modification would be
that if sand were piled on to the obelisk in the initial
stages of its descent, the weight of the sand would be a
great help in forcing the base down the funnel past the
point where it might be likely to jam. It would, however,
make the examination of the obelisk during its descent a
difficult matter owing to lack of space.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers Clarke points out that, if the obelisk came
down on to its pedestal supported on one edge, that the
strain would crush the granite. It seems that the slot
in the pedestal served a double purpose, one to keep the
obelisk from twisting, and the other to ensure that the
weight <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span> is taken
on the edge of the slot and not on the edge of the obelisk
(see fig. <a href="#fig8" title="go to &#x66;ig. 8">8</a>).
Let us assume that the edge of the slot crushes until there
is 2 inches of supporting surface; then since the obelisk
is about 165 inches along its base, the bearing surface
will be 330 square inches and the resulting crushing
stress about 3&#x202f;½ tons per square inch, which is
not so very excessive. By putting moderately soft wood
in the slot, the weight could be borne both by the edge
of the obelisk and the edge of the slot, thus further
reducing the stress set up. In the case of the standing
obelisk of <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png" width="49" height="82"
alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> it has come down without
engaging in the slot, with the result that the corners have
crushed considerably.</p>

pedestal.</div> </div><!--dctr01-->

<p>Figure 8 shews the position of this obelisk as it now
stands on its pedestal, the position taken up being C&#x2060;D&#x2060;E&#x2060;F
instead of C′&#x2060;D′&#x2060;E′&#x2060;F′. The corners E and F have split
badly owing to the great weight and have been rounded to
cover up the defect. In this case the inner side of the
slot, A&#x2060;B, as far as can now be seen, is still sharp. In
all the other pedestals I have examined, where the obelisks
have apparently come down so as to bear on the inner edge
of the slot, the edge is very distinctly crushed.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa741">(41)
Before the obelisk was pulled upright, the space in
front of the obelisk, and between it and the wall B, might
well be filled up with <i>halfa</i> and reeds, to make a kind
of cushion, and to damp any tendency to rock backwards
and forwards. The notch would prevent any twist before it
engaged with the reed cushion. If the obelisk twisted, it
was because the reed cushion was not sufficiently tightly
packed, the twist taking place after it had rocked over to
its further edge.</p>

<p>If the obelisk was on a sledge, I should think that it was
removed before introducing it into the mouth of the funnel;
the removal of the rollers would be automatic.</p>

<p>The raising of the obelisk without the aid of an embankment
is proposed by Choisy in <i>L’Art de bâtir chez les
Égyptiens</i>. He assumes that the obelisk was raised by a
series of levers used horizontally on a fulcrum, and that
it was heaved up simultaneously from both sides and packed
from below after each heave, the obelisk and levers rising
together till the obelisk was sufficiently high to lower on
to the pedestal (cf. section
<a href="#pa750" title="go to § 50">50</a> and fig.
<a href="#fig11" title="go to &#x66;ig. 11">11</a>).</p>

<p>Let us assume that this method was to be used for the Aswân
obelisk. I think that the largest levers practicable would
be 15 metre tree-trunks used with a mechanical advantage
of 10 to 1. Not more than 30 levers could be used on each
side of the obelisk. The number of men required to raise
the obelisk can be found to be about 56 per lever, assuming
that they all heave at the end. I hardly see how such a
number can be put on a horizontal lever unless we assume
that a cross-baulk is attached along the ends of the levers
and the whole loaded with stones. The levers would have to
be dismounted at each heave and the time taken would be
considerable. The method, however, is a possibility, so I
include it as an alternative to the embankment.
<span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span></p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa742">(42)
Before leaving this subject, it is as well to
ascertain if the obelisk is strong enough to bear the
internal strain due to its own weight when it is supported
at its centre of gravity.</p>

<p>The volume of a truncated cone is given by the formula V
<span class="nowrap">=&nbsp;H/3&#x202f;(A<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;A&#x2060;<i>a</i>
<span class="nowrap">+&nbsp;<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>).</span></p>

<p>In the shaft of this obelisk, H is 37.25, A is 4.20
and <i>a</i> is 2.50 metres. Substituting, we have: V <span
class="nowrap">=&nbsp;37.25/3&#x202f;{(4.2)<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;4.2 ×&nbsp;2.5 <span class="nowrap">+&nbsp;(2.5)<sup>2</sup>}</span>
from which we find that the volume of the shaft is 426
cubic metres. Aswân granite weighs about 2.679 tons per
cubic metre, which makes the shaft weigh 1143 tons.</p>

<p>The weight of the pyramidion is
<span class="nowrap">{(base)<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;(height)&#x202f;(unit</span>
weight)}/3&#x2060;, or
<span class="nowrap">(2.50)<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;(4.50)&#x202f;(2.679)/3</span> =&nbsp;25
tons, so that the total weight of the obelisk would have
been 1143 +&nbsp;25 =&nbsp;1168 tons.</p>

<p>The distance of the centre of gravity
of a tapering square-sectioned solid from
the butt is given by the formula: <span
class="nowrap">{¼&#x202f;H&#x202f;(A<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;2&#x2060;A&#x2060;<i>a</i> <span
class="nowrap">+&nbsp;3&#x2060;<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)}/(A<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;A&#x2060;<i>a</i> <span
class="nowrap">+&nbsp;<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>).</span></p>

<p>Here H is 37.25&#x202f;m.; A =&nbsp;4.2&#x202f;m.; <i>a</i>
=&nbsp;2.5&#x202f;m.</p>

<p>Substituting we get: <span
class="nowrap">(37.25/4)&#x202f;{[(4.20)<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;2&#x202f;(2.50 ×&nbsp;4.20) <span
class="nowrap">+&nbsp;3&#x202f;(2.50)<sup>2</sup>]/[(4.20)<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;(2.50 ×&nbsp;4.20) <span
class="nowrap">+&nbsp;(2.50)<sup>2</sup>]}.</span></p>

<p>That is, the distance of the C.&#x202f;G. from the
butt, (L&#x2060;N on fig. <a href="#fig11"
title="go to &#x66;ig. 11">11</a>), is 15.35 metres.</p>

<p>Taking the pyramidion by itself. Its height is 4.50 metres,
so that its C.&#x202f;G. must be one-fourth that distance from the
base, which makes 1.12 metres.</p>

<p>If <i>x</i> is the distance of the centre of gravity of the
whole obelisk from the butt, by taking moments about the
butt we have: (Total weight) ×&nbsp;<i>x</i> =&nbsp;(weight
of pyramidion) ×&nbsp;(1.12 +&nbsp;length of shaft)
+&nbsp;(weight of shaft) ×&nbsp;15.35, or 1168&#x202f;<i>x</i>
=&nbsp;25 ×&nbsp;38.37 +&nbsp;1143 ×&nbsp;15.35, from which
<i>x</i> =&nbsp;15.84. <i>That is, the distance of the centre
of gravity of the whole obelisk from the butt is 15.84
metres.</i></p>

<p>The breadth of the obelisk at its centre of gravity is 4.2
−&nbsp;(15.84/37.25) ×&nbsp;(4.2 −&nbsp;2.5) or 3.49 metres.</p>

<p class="pa7" id="pa743">(43)
Let us assume that the obelisk is balanced at its
C.&#x202f;G., and find the stresses due to bending.
The weight on each side will be equal. Taking
the right hand half, its weight will act at its
C.&#x202f;G. Using the formula for the C.&#x202f;G.
of a tapering square-sectioned solid, quoted above,
we get: <span class="nowrap">(15.84/4)&#x202f;{[(4.20)<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;2&#x202f;(4.20)&#x202f;(3.49)
<span class="nowrap">+&nbsp;3&#x202f;(3.49)<sup>2</sup>]/[(4.20)<sup>2</sup></span>
+&nbsp;(4.20)&#x202f;(3.49) <span class="nowrap">+&nbsp;(3.49)<sup>2</sup>]}</span>
=&#x202f;7.43 metres, which means that the centre of
gravity of the right-hand half of the obelisk will act
at a distance of 7.43 metres from the butt, or 15.84
−&nbsp;7.43 =&nbsp;8.41 metres from the balancing point, or
C.&#x202f;G. of the whole obelisk.</p>

<p>The sum of the moments to the right of the C.&#x202f;G. of the
whole obelisk will be half the total weight multiplied by
8.41 =&nbsp;584 ×&nbsp;8.41.</p>

<p>Then, if <i>s</i> is the internal stress set up due to the
bending of the obelisk when supported at its C.&#x202f;G., we have:</p>

<p>(Section modulus)&#x202f;(stress) =&nbsp;sum of moments
on one side of support.</p>

<p>The modulus of the square section is one
sixth the cube of the depth, so we have: {(3.49
<span class="nowrap">×&nbsp;39.37)<sup>3</sup>/6}&#x202f;<i>s</i></span> =&nbsp;584
×&nbsp;8.41 ×&nbsp;39.37 ×&nbsp;2240.</p>

<p>From which <i>s</i> =&nbsp;1001 pounds per square inch
(39.37 being the reduction of metres to inches). <span
class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span></p>

<p>The modulus of rupture for granite from Aswân is given as
1500 pounds per square inch, so it will be seen that the
obelisk, if not converted into a live load (by a jerk, for
instance) can be supported at its C.&#x202f;G. without breaking.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to say how far the Egyptians were
able to carry their calculations. The erection could well
have been rehearsed by means of a scale-model, which could
have been further used for obtaining the weight and the
position of the centre of gravity. I do not think that
they ever troubled about the bending-moment; at any rate,
their mathematics were not sufficiently advanced for its
determination. It may be that, since in all the obelisks we
know of, whose taper does not vary to any great extent, can
be supported anywhere, the Egyptians never had a case of
such a monument breaking by its own weight.</p>

<p>Another interesting point arises in connection with this,
and that is, since in obelisks (and all beams) of the
same proportion, the bending stress due to their own
weight depends on the linear dimension, and therefore
the fact that a granite scale-model does not break will
be no indication that the monument itself will not break
when similarly supported. If the 108 cubit (56.70 metres)
obelisk of <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e24.png"
width="49" height="82" alt="Ḥ" />atshepsôwet,</span> mentioned by
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/tdotbelow-1e6c.png"
width="42" height="82" alt="Ṭ" /><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />utiy</span>
(section
<a href="#pa703" title="go to § 3">3</a>),
does indeed apply to <i>one</i> and not to the <i>two</i> placed butt
to butt on the boat shewn in the Dêr <span class="nowrap">el-Ba<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/hdotbelow-1e25.png"
width="36" height="82" alt="ḥ" />ari</span> sculpture,
then, if the proportions are about the same as the Aswân
obelisk, the stress set up when supported at its centre
of gravity (see section
<a href="#pa740" title="go to § 40">40</a>) would be in the nature of
56.70 ×&nbsp;1001/41.75 =&nbsp;1360 pounds per square inch, which
is perilously near the breaking stress of 1500 pounds per
square inch.</p>

<p>It will be clearly seen that the obelisk, part of which is
at Constantinople, cannot have been part of the 108‐cubit
obelisk, as it would be much thinner than the one at Aswân
and would certainly not support its own weight either at
the centre of gravity or at its ends. When worked out, the
internal stress set up in such an obelisk more than doubles
the ultimate strength of granite.</p>

During the clearance of the west end of the north
trench, a small pot was found, of the form shewn in figure
9, containing a small quantity of a substance which had the
appearance of red brick dust. The pot appears to have had a
neck, but it is now missing, and a section has been broken
out of the side. On the other side of the pot there is a
small hole. The shape of the pot is not characteristic,
and it may well be of a date later than that of the
obelisk. The glaze is of a dark reddish-brown colour, and
is the coarsest I have ever seen, being very uneven and
covered with bubble-craters. The Director of the Chemical
Department kindly allowed analyses to be made of the glaze
and also of the contents of the pot. As regards the glaze,
Mr. W. B. Pollard of the Chemical Department staff, who has
had experience in the analysis of glazes, has suggested
that it is a natural one, perhaps due to the pot lying in
a fire of burning vegetable matter. This seems very likely
since there seems to have been a great deal of burning in
removing the upper layers of granite during the extraction
of monuments from the quarries (section
<a href="#pa704" title="go to § 4">4</a>).</p>

<p>The contents of the pot are reported to be ochre and not
burnt brick, though the ochre is of poor quality. It seems
that we have here the material of the paint used in the

gum.</p>

During the clearance of the west end of the north trench,
we found part of an ostrakon in the hieratic character. It

common to the <span class="nowrap">XVIII<sup>th</sup>–XIX<sup>th</sup></span> dynasty.

There are over 25 obelisks known to-day whose weights
exceed 50 tons, and all must have come from Aswân, since
it is the only convenient outcrop of granite in Egypt. It
might well be asked from which quarries they have been
taken. I have examined most of the quarries about Aswân
and Shellâl, but must admit that I have not found one from
which I am sure that an obelisk has been extracted. I think
that, at any rate, some must have been taken from the
quarries in the near neighbourhood of the Aswân obelisk,
as the stratum is good, and it is the most conveniently
situated from the river bank. It would well repay the
trouble taken to clear the quarry to the south, and the
valley leading up to the obelisk, completely, exposing the
floor, as it is there that we may expect to find the bed
of one of the larger obelisks. It must be borne in mind
however, that a quarry, good enough to furnish a large
obelisk, would be worked as long as there was good stone
to be extracted from it. The sand does not come in at any
alarming rate, and a credit of L. E. 5 every year would be
sufficient to keep the whole quarry clear. I estimate the
cost of completely clearing the south quarry and the valley
at L. E. 1500. It would leave a magnificent monument.</p>

have been the ancient methods of building, together with
his ideas as to those of the transportation and erection of
monoliths. The chapters on construction do not come within

pages 121 to 127. Under the heading of ‘extraction’, he
gives some suggestions, or rather assertions, as to the
manner in which the obelisk was given a curved surface, but
none as to the quarry work. In his notes on transport by
water, he favours the method described by Pliny (section
34 of this volume), which we know is not confirmed by an
examination of the Aswân quarries. As to the method he
proposes for the transport of obelisks, it is extremely
laborious; the obelisk was heaved up by a series of levers
acting on both sides simultaneously, <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span> being packed
from below after each heave. Figure 11, taken from his
book, makes this clear. When the obelisk was sufficiently
high, an embankment was constructed so as to make a ramp
leading <i>down</i> in the direction in which it was desired
to travel, and the obelisk was pulled, butt foremost,
along the ramp until it reached ground-level again, the
process being repeated for the whole journey. His method
for erecting an obelisk is, to me, mechanically unsound.
Figure 12 is taken from his book; referring to it, he says:
“Soulevons le bloc (fig. <a href="#fig11" title="go to &#x66;ig. 11">11</a>), en ayant soin de maintenir
le remblai d’appui par les bajoyers. Arrivés à une hauteur
telle que <i>a′</i>, passons, par-dessous, des traverses <i>c</i> et
un tourillon <i>n</i>. A ce moment rien n’empêche de déblayer
les terres et d’établir en sous-œuvre une glissière <i>g</i>.
La glissière faite, remplaçons par du sable les terres
enlevées; retirons les traverses <i>c</i> et affouillons le
sable. L’obélisque, pivotant autour du tourillon <i>n</i>,
va s’incliner suivant <i>a″</i> et arriver à l’aplomb de sa
base <i>b</i>. Il suffira pour empêcher d’aller trop long, de
réserver en <i>d</i> un arrêt qui le contre-bute du pied, et de
retenir le sommet par des haubans.”</p>

<p>Choisy imagines the procedure after the obelisk had
attained a vertical position to have been to fill in the
space between the obelisk and the pedestal with filled
sand-bags, a long sausage-shaped bag having been placed
in the slot in the pedestal. The bags were then to be
perforated <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span> one by one until the obelisk rested on
its edge and the long bag only. The empty bags were to be
withdrawn from under the obelisk and finally the long bag
opened and the material removed through the slot. This
may possibly have been the method used with medium-sized
blocks, such as sarcophagus-lids, but I very much doubt
whether any bag would stand half the weight of the Aswân
obelisk without bursting, besides, the crushing of the
inner edge of the slots in the pedestals of all the
obelisks at Karnak, except that of the standing obelisk

<i>Della transportatione dell’obelisco Vaticano et delle
fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavaliere
Domenico Fontana, architecto di sua Santità</i>.—This is a
rare book published in 1590, but a good précis is given
by Lebas in his <i>L’Obélisque de Louxor</i> and in <span
class="smcap">G<b>ORRINGE</b>,</span> <i>Egyptian Obelisks</i>.
The obelisk was moved from the Circus of Nero at Rome to
the Piazza di San Pietro in 1585, the method being the
‘heroic’ one of lifting it bodily by blocks and tackles. A
gigantic tower of wood, known as ‘Fontana’s Castle’, was
erected over the obelisk, being made of compound wooden
struts of a metre square in section. From the cross-beams
of the tower pairs of blocks and tackles were attached
at four points along the obelisk, which was protected
by matting and planks. The obelisk was first raised
sufficiently high, being wedged as well from below, to
enable a ‘cradle’, or platform on rollers, to be introduced
underneath it. The obelisk was then lowered on to the
cradle and pulled to its new site, first down an inclined
plane and thence on level ground. The blocks and tackles
were worked by a large number of capstans. The erection
was done in exactly the reverse way to the lowering.
The whole story as translated by Lebas, makes curious
reading, and I cannot resist giving a few extracts. He
says (<i>L’Obélisque de Louxor</i>, pp. 178 et seq.): “Public
curiosity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. attracted a
large number of strangers to Rome. All roads leading to
the square were barricaded, and a <i>bando</i> of the pope,
published two days before, <i>punished by death</i> anybody who
did not respect the barrier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
On the <span class="nowrap">30<sup>th</sup></span> April, two hours before daylight,
two masses were celebrated to <span class="xxpn"
id="p052">{52}</span> implore the light of the Holy
Spirit. Fontana, with all his staff, communicated. On
the eve of the lowering he had been blessed by the Holy
Father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;” Before the work
began, Fontana told his workmen: “The work we are about to
undertake is consecrated to religion, the exaltation of
the Holy Cross”; thereon everyone recited with Fontana a
<i>pater</i> and an <i>ave</i>. Gorringe comments on this (<i>Egyptian
Obelisks</i>, pp. 114 to 117) saying: “A striking scene it
must have been and <i>typical of that curious age</i>”. If,
however, one compares Fontana’s account with that of the
erection of the New York obelisk, one is struck, not with
the difference, but with the resemblance between the two
ceremonies, the later one being undoubtedly more tedious to
the spectators, as there were no inquisitors and familiars
waiting in a corner, to mete out summary punishment to
anyone misbehaving.</p>

<i>Egyptian Obelisks</i>, published in 1885 by Nimmo,
14, King William St., Strand.—The obelisk, which originally
formed a pair with the London Obelisk, had already been
once removed in Roman times from Heliopolis to Alexandria,
where it was still standing. It was lowered by fitting it
at its centre of gravity, with a pair of enormous steel
trunnions supported by a steel tower on each side of the
obelisk. The point was lowered (or rather it crashed)
on to a tower made of wooden baulks laid alternately. A
similar wooden tower was then built near the butt end of
the obelisk and after raising the obelisk from each end
with hydraulic rams, the trunnions were removed. The mass
was then lowered from each side in turn by supporting
the obelisk by the rams while a course of baulks were
removed from the tower, and continuing the process until
the obelisk lay on the ground. It was floated in a wooden
caisson from the shore to the dock and introduced into a
steamship called the <i>Dessouk</i> by opening a port in her
bows. At the American end, it was placed on a railway line
and pulled to Central Park, where the trunnion and towers
were again used in the opposite order to the lowering. For
the short moves, such as moving it into the hold of the
ship, it was rolled on cannon-balls running in channel
irons. <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span></p>

<p>In the publication there is a very good account of the
history of the obelisk and an excellent collection of
classical and mediæval records relating to the subject. In
his ‘record of all Obelisks’ he gives poor photographs of
one face of each, accompanied by ‘best translations’ of
the inscriptions, where the roughest hand-copies of the
text would have been infinitely more valuable. Nowhere in
the book can I find a complete series of measurements of
the New York obelisk; in a table on page 145 he gives the
heights, width at the base and the estimated weight only.
To make up for this, the analysis of the granite and of the
copper ‘crabs’ is given with extraordinary detail, and we
are given a complete list of the objects placed under the
obelisk on re-erection, which range from sets of coinage
and standard works (p. 33), to <i>a small box, the contents
of which were known only to himself</i> (that is to a certain
Mr. Henry Hurlbert). Cleopatra’s Needle, now rotting on
the Thames Embankment, we are told, has beneath it among
other things, a Mappin’s Shilling Razor, an Alexandra
Feeding-bottle, a case of cigars and photographs of a dozen
pretty English women for the benefit of posterity!</p>

<p>In Gorringe’s work, verbatim reports of pompous speeches,
of which each stage of the proceedings seemed to provoke
cataracts, total 18 pages of small type, while long
dissertations are indulged in on the presence of ‘masonic
emblems’ discovered in the base of the obelisk at
Alexandria, and on their esoteric meaning; this in spite of
the fact that their ‘most expert archæologist’ points out
the obvious explanation that the signs commented on form
part of an Egyptian word determined by the <i>house</i>-sign,
and the ‘mysterious lines’, etc., are merely fragments of
ordinary decoration from a re-used building.</p>

and raising was performed by a huge compound derrick,
consisting of five supporting members on each side of
the obelisk, the power being supplied by capstans and
blocks and tackles. The obelisk was lowered on to a wooden
cradle on which it was dragged over a greased way, without
rollers, to the water, and from the water to its present
position in the Place de la Concorde. The water transport
was effected by a pontoon-raft of peculiar design, the prow
of which was removed for getting the obelisk in and out.

the cutting of hieroglyphs. On the erection of obelisks
he says (page 77), referring to the setting up of colossi
under Ramesses IV: “A causeway of earth was made sloping
up for the length of a quarter of a mile; it was 93 feet
wide and 103 feet high on the slope, probably about 60 or
70 feet vertically, as the slopes were held up steeply
with facings of timber and brushwood. The purpose of this
evidently was to raise the great block by sliding it on its
side up the slope and then to tilt it upright by gravity
over the head of the slope. How the mass would be turned
we have nothing to show, but probably the simplest way,
by gradually removing earth, would be followed. By next
ramming earth behind the obelisk as it lay on the slope,
it would be quite practicable to force it forward into an
upright position.”</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been
generally retained, with some exceptions noted below.
Original printed page numbers are shown like this: {52}.
Anchored notes (e.g. footnotes) have been relabeled
1–13, and moved from within paragraphs to nearby locations
between paragraphs. Large curly brackets {&#x202f;} that
graphically indicate combination of information on two
or more lines of text have been removed. Several Unicode
characters that are poorly supported in current ebook
browsers have been replaced with images: ‹Ḥ› U+1e24,
‹ḥ› U+1e25, ‹ḫ› U+1e2b, ‹Ṭ› U+1e6c, and ‹ṭ› U+1e6d. I
produced the cover image and hereby assign it
to the public domain. Original page images are available
from archive.org—search for “aswnobeliskwiths00egyp”.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
